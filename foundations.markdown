Foundations of Right Believing
========================================================================


Have faith in Jesus.  Believe in, trust in, and rely on Jesus.
--------------------------------------------------------------

Romans 10:1-13 in its entirety is a great read.  How are you saved?  Here are the salvation verses.

{"verse": "Romans 10:9-13"}
Because if you acknowledge and **confess** with your lips that Jesus is Lord and in your heart **believe** (adhere to, trust in, and rely on the truth) that God raised Him from the dead, **you will be saved**.  For with the heart a person **believes** (adheres to, trusts in, and relies on Christ) and so is justified (declared righteous, acceptable to God), and with the mouth he **confesses** (declares openly and speaks out freely his faith) and **confirms [his] salvation**.  The Scripture says, **No man** who believes in Him [who adheres to, relies on, and trusts in Him] will [**ever**] be put to shame or be disappointed.  [No one] for there is no distinction between Jew and Greek. The same Lord is Lord over all [of us] and He generously bestows His riches upon **all** who call upon Him [in **faith**].  For **everyone** who calls upon the name of the Lord [invoking Him as Lord] **will be saved**.

Meaning of the New Covenant
---------------------------

Hebrews explains the following quote is God explaining the new covenant.

{"verse": "Hebrews 8:7-13"}
However, He finds fault with them [showing its inadequacy] when He says, Behold, the days will come, says the Lord, when I will make and ratify a new covenant or agreement with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah.  It will not be like the covenant that I made with their forefathers on the day when I grasped them by the hand to help and relieve them and to lead them out from the land of Egypt, for they did not abide in My agreement with them, and so I withdrew My favor and disregarded them, says the Lord.  For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord: **I will imprint My laws upon their minds, even upon their innermost thoughts and understanding, and engrave them upon their hearts**; and I will be their God, and they shall be My people.  And it will nevermore be necessary for each one to teach his neighbor and his fellow citizen or each one his brother, saying, Know (perceive, have knowledge of, and get acquainted by experience with) the Lord, for all will know Me, from the smallest to the greatest of them.  For **I will be merciful and gracious toward their sins and I will remember their deeds of unrighteousness no more**. When God speaks of a new [covenant or agreement], He makes the first one obsolete (out of use). And what is obsolete (out of use and annulled because of age) is ripe for disappearance and to be dispensed with altogether.

Of all that, the Holy Spirit especially wants you to understand and believe two main points---so He repeats them again in Hebrews chapter 10.

{"verse": "Hebrews 10:16-17"}
This is the agreement (testament, covenant) that I will set up and conclude with them after those days, says the Lord: I will imprint My laws upon their hearts, and I will inscribe them on their minds (on their inmost thoughts and understanding), He then goes on to say, And their sins and their lawbreaking I will remember no more.

The Law Shows Our Sinfulness
----------------------------

From the second half of Romans 1 until half-way through Romans 3, Paul explains that everyone is condemned apart from Jesus Christ.  Whether we know the law or not.  Whether we teach the law or not:  we are all condemned apart from Christ (unbelievers, Jews, and teachers of the law.)  Then, in chapter 3, Romans explains that the purpose of the law is to show us our sinfulness.

{"verse": "Romans 3:19-22"}
Now we know that whatever the Law says, **it speaks to those who are under the Law**, so that [the murmurs and excuses of] every mouth may be hushed and all **the world may be held accountable to God**.  For **no person** will be justified (made righteous, acquitted, and judged acceptable) in His sight by observing the works prescribed by the Law. **For [the real function of] the Law is to make men recognize and be conscious of sin** [[a]not mere perception, but an acquaintance with sin which works toward repentance, faith, and holy character].  But now the righteousness of God has been revealed independently and **altogether apart from the Law**, although actually it is attested by the Law and the Prophets, Namely, **the righteousness of God which comes by believing** with personal trust and confident reliance on Jesus Christ (the Messiah). [And it is meant] **for all who believe**. For there is no distinction,

{"verse": "Romans 3:28"}
For we hold that a man is **justified and made upright by faith** independent of and distinctly **apart from good deeds** (works of the Law). [The observance of the Law has nothing to do with justification.]

Notice, the Lord wants us to have faith and depend on Him instead of depending on our own self-effort under the law.  We cannot uphold the law by our self-effort.  But by having faith in Jesus, we implicitly uphold the law.

{"verse": "Romans 3:31"}
Do we then by [this] faith make the Law of no effect, overthrow it or make it a dead letter? Certainly not! On the contrary, we confirm and establish and **uphold the Law**.

{"verse": "Romans 5:13"}
[To be sure] sin was in the world before ever the Law was given, but sin is not charged to men's account where there is no law [to transgress].

{"verse": "Romans 5:20"}
But then Law came in, [only] to expand and increase the trespass [making it more apparent and exciting opposition]. But where sin increased and abounded, grace (God's unmerited favor) has surpassed it and increased the more and superabounded,

Now read Galatians 3

{"verse": "Galatians 3:1-14"}
O YOU poor and silly and thoughtless and unreflecting and senseless Galatians! Who has fascinated or bewitched or cast a spell over you, unto whom--right before your very eyes--Jesus Christ (the Messiah) was openly and graphically set forth and portrayed as crucified?  Let me ask you this one question: Did you receive the [Holy] Spirit as the result of obeying the Law and doing its works, or was it by hearing [the message of the Gospel] and believing [it]? [Was it from observing a law of rituals or from a message of faith?] Are you so foolish and so senseless and so silly? Having begun [your new life spiritually] with the [Holy] Spirit, are you now reaching perfection [by dependence] on the flesh?  Have you suffered so many things and experienced so much all for nothing (to no purpose)--if it really is to no purpose and in vain?  Then does He Who supplies you with His marvelous [Holy] Spirit and works powerfully and miraculously among you do so on [the grounds of your doing] what the Law demands, or because of your believing in and adhering to and trusting in and relying on the message that you heard?  Thus Abraham believed in and adhered to and trusted in and relied on God, and it was reckoned and placed to his account and credited as righteousness (as conformity to the divine will in purpose, thought, and action). Know and understand that it is [really] the people [who live] by faith who are [the true] sons of Abraham.  And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify (declare righteous, put in right standing with Himself) the Gentiles in consequence of faith, proclaimed the Gospel [foretelling the glad tidings of a Savior long beforehand] to Abraham in the promise, saying, In you shall all the nations [of the earth] be blessed.  So then, those who are people of faith are blessed and made happy and favored by God [as partners in fellowship] with the believing and trusting Abraham.   And all who depend on the Law [who are seeking to be justified by obedience to the Law of rituals] are under a curse and doomed to disappointment and destruction, for it is written in the Scriptures, Cursed (accursed, devoted to destruction, doomed to eternal punishment) be everyone who does not continue to abide (live and remain) by all the precepts and commands written in the Book of the Law and to practice them.  Now it is evident that no person is justified (declared righteous and brought into right standing with God) through the Law, for the Scripture says, The man in right standing with God [the just, the righteous] shall live by and out of faith and he who through and by faith is declared righteous and in right standing with God shall live.  But the Law does not rest on faith [does not require faith, has nothing to do with faith], for it itself says, He who does them [the things prescribed by the Law] shall live by them [not by faith].  Christ purchased our freedom [redeeming us] from the curse (doom) of the Law [and its condemnation] by [Himself] becoming a curse for us, for it is written [in the Scriptures], Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree (is crucified); To the end that through [their receiving] Christ Jesus, the blessing [promised] to Abraham might come upon the Gentiles, so that we through faith might [all] receive [the realization of] the promise of the [Holy] Spirit.

Reading the bible and being religious has no power.  Only when you believe does reading the bible benefit you.  The good news must be mixed with faith to be effective.

{"verse": "John 5:37-47"}
And the Father Who sent Me has Himself testified concerning Me. Not one of you has ever given ear to His voice or seen His form (His face--what He is like). [You have always been deaf to His voice and blind to the vision of Him.] And you have not His word (His thought) living in your hearts, because you do not believe and adhere to and trust in and rely on Him Whom He has sent. [That is why you do not keep His message living in you, because you do not believe in the Messenger Whom He has sent.] **You search and investigate and pore over the Scriptures diligently, because you suppose and trust that you have eternal life through them.** And these [very Scriptures] testify about Me!  And still you are not willing [but refuse] to come to Me, so that you might have life.  I receive not glory from men [I crave no human honor, I look for no mortal fame], But I know you and recognize and understand that you have not the love of God in you.  I have come in My Father's name and with His power, and you do not receive Me [your hearts are not open to Me, you give Me no welcome]; but if another comes in his own name and his own power and with no other authority but himself, you will receive him and give him your approval.  How is it possible for you to believe [how can you learn to believe], you who [are content to seek and] receive praise and honor and glory from one another, and yet do not seek the praise and honor and glory which come from Him Who alone is God?  Put out of your minds the thought and do not suppose [as some of you are supposing] that I will accuse you before the Father. There is one who accuses you--it is Moses, the very one on whom you have built your hopes [in whom you trust].  For if you believed and relied on Moses, you would believe and rely on Me, for he wrote about Me [personally].  But if you do not believe and trust his writings, how then will you believe and trust My teachings? [How shall you cleave to and rely on My words?]

Everything that does not come from faith is sin.

{"verse": "Romans 14:23"}
But the man who has doubts (misgivings, an uneasy conscience) about eating, and then eats [perhaps because of you], stands condemned [before God], because he is not true to his convictions and he does not act from faith. For **whatever does not originate and proceed from faith is sin** [whatever is done without a conviction of its approval by God is sinful].

Without faith it is impossible to please God.

{"verse": "Hebrews 11:6"}
But **without faith it is impossible to please and be satisfactory to Him**. For whoever would come near to God must [necessarily] believe that God exists and that He is the rewarder of those who earnestly and diligently seek Him [out].

{"verse": "Romans 5:17"}
For if because of one man's trespass (lapse, offense) death reigned through that one, much more surely will those who **receive [God's] overflowing grace (unmerited favor)** and **the free gift of righteousness** [putting them into right standing with Himself] reign as kings in life through the one Man Jesus Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed One)

{"verse": "Romans 6:11"}
Even so consider yourselves also dead to sin and your relation to it broken, but alive to God [living in unbroken fellowship with Him] in Christ Jesus.

{"verse": "Romans 6:14"}
For sin shall not [any longer] exert dominion over you, since now you are not under **Law** [as slaves], but under **grace** [as subjects of God's favor and mercy].
