Hebrews 4
========================================================================

Don't miss out on God's rest.  It is a promise from God, which means it depends only on God to provide the rest.  Our part is to believe.

{"verse": "Hebrews 4:1"}
1 Therefore let's take care to make sure that even though God has given us his **promise** of entering his **rest**, none of you miss out!

The Amplified bible says "let us be afraid to distrust" the promise of entering His rest.

The good news of Jesus Christ only benefits those who accept and trust and believe in it.

{"verse": "Hebrews 4:2"}
2 For we've heard the good news just like they did, but it didn't help them because they didn't **accept** and **trust** in what they heard.

'They' is referring to the Israelites in the desert and the good news they heard was the promise of deliverance from bondage.  We also heard the Good News of Jesus Christ in which Jesus Christ has delivered us from bondage to the law as we saw in chapter 3.

"**have entered**" is past tense.  We have already entered His rest.  We entered it by believing and trusting in the Good News of Jesus Christ.  Now enjoy the rest.

The rest is for us who trust in God; it is for us who have faith.

{"verse": "Hebrews 4:3"}
3 However those of us who **trust in God** have entered into that rest God mentioned when he said, "In my frustration I vowed, 'They shall not enter my rest.'" (This is so even though God's plans were already complete when he created the world).

Rest is holy.

{"verse": "Hebrews 4:4"}
4 Regarding the seventh day there's a place in Scripture that says, "God rested on the seventh day from all his work."

{"verse": "Hebrews 4:5"}
5 And as the previous passage stated, "They shall not enter my rest."

God's rest is available for us new-covenant believers today!  This is not an offer that already expired or a promise to be fulfilled in heaven.  It is for today.

The example of disobedience is unbelief as we saw in Chapter 3.

{"verse": "Hebrews 4:6-8"}
6 **God's rest is still there** for some to enter, even though those who previously heard the good news failed to enter because of disobedience.  7 So God again sets a day---today---saying a long time later through David a as he did before, "If you hear what God is saying to you today, **don't harden your hearts**."  8 For if Joshua had been able to give them rest, God wouldn't have spoken later about another day.

The true rest is for us today.  Don't harden your heart to God's grace.

{"verse": "Hebrews 4:9"}
9 So **a Sabbath rest remains for God's people**.

{"verse": "Hebrews 4:10"}
10 For whoever enters God's rest also rests from what he's doing, just as God did.

The Amplified Bible expands "doing" to **[the weariness and pain] of human labors**.  Weariness and pain is what you produce when you labor under the law.

{"verse": "Hebrews 4:10 Amplified Bible"}
For he who has once entered [God's] rest also has ceased from [**the weariness and pain] of human labors**, just as God rested from those labors peculiarly His own.

God is saying to you today, if you want to work, then work to enter His rest.  Above all else, rest in the finished work of Christ Jesus!  Rest is holy.  He says to **try hard** to enter his rest.  Expend a great effort---whatever is necessary---to enter His rest.  You enter His rest by believing and having faith in the finished work of Jesus Christ.  Believe you have been saved by his death on the cross and made righteous by his resurrection.

The example of disobedience is unbelief as we saw in Chapter 3.

{"verse": "Hebrews 4:11"}
11 As a result we should **try hard to enter that rest** so nobody falls through following the same bad
example of disobedience.

God sees everything you do.  You are accountable to be obedient to His word.  He is commanding you to rest.  So be obedient to the faith, and rest.

{"verse": "Hebrews 4:12-13"}
12 For God's word is alive and effective, sharper than any twin-edged sword, so penetrating it separates life and breath, bone joints and their marrow, judging the thoughts and intentions of the mind.  13 No living being is hidden from his sight; everything is exposed and visible to the one weâ€™re accountable to.

Jesus is our perfect High Priest forever.  He is always for us.  Again, you are commanded to believe in Jesus!

{"verse": "Hebrews 4:14"}
14 Since we have such a **great high priest** who has ascended to heaven, **Jesus the Son of God**, let us
make sure we hold on to what we say **we believe**.

Jesus is perfect; He never sinned.  Because we have been perfectly cleansed by His blood, we can approach God's throne with perfect confidence knowing we will not be condemned because we are righteous by faith in Jesus.  This is why we can rest, because the work of Jesus on the cross is a finished and complete work.  Notice, that for the new covenant believer, God's throne is a throne of grace, **NOT** a throne of judgement.  Judgement is for those under the law, not those under grace.  All of your sins (past, present, and future) have already been judged at the cross in the body of Christ Jesus.

{"verse": "Hebrews 4:15-16"}
15 For the **high priest** we have isn't one who doesn't sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who was tempted in all the ways we are, but **did not sin**.  16 So we should go **confidently** to God on his throne of **grace** so we can receive **mercy**, and discover the **grace** to **help us** when we really need it.
