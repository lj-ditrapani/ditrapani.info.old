v
John 15:4-17
"Remain in me, and I will remain in you. Just as the branch cannot bear fruit by itself, unless it remains in the vine, so neither can you unless you remain in me. I am the vine; you are the branches. The one who remains in me---and I in him---bears much fruit, because apart from me you can accomplish nothing. If anyone does not remain in me, he is thrown out like a branch, and dries up; and such branches are gathered up and thrown into the fire, and are burned up.  If you remain in me and my words remain in you, ask whatever you want, and it will be done for you.  My Father is honored by this, that you bear much fruit and show that you are my disciples. Just as the Father has loved me, I have also loved you; remain in my love. If you obey my commandments, you will remain in my love, just as I have obeyed my Father's commandments and remain in his love. I have told you these things so that my joy may be in you, and your joy may be complete. My commandment is this---to love one another just as I have loved you. No one has greater love than this---that one lays down his life for his friends. You are my friends if you do what I command you. I no longer call you slaves, because the slave does not understand what his master is doing. But I have called you friends, because I have revealed to you everything I heard from my Father. You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you to go and bear fruit, fruit that remains, so that whatever you ask the Father in my name he will give you. This I command you---to love one another."

<h2> When you know the father is providing for your needs, you will love others freely </h2>
</other>

I thought this was really cool.  Jesus talks about not judging others, and then, verse 12, again says to treat others as you want to be treated.  These are both commands to love others.  But what do verses 7-11 talk about?  Depending on, trusting in and relying on your heavenly father to provide for all your needs.  Because when you do that, you will naturally love others; we will naturally refrain from judging others and being mean to others.  When God is our father, that's when we live right.  I believe verses 7-11 are sandwiched between commands to love others on purpose, because it is the solution to the problem.

 Today God is our father because Jesus paid our way into heaven and into His heavenly family.  We are God's children by the blood of Jesus!  Hallelujah!

v
Matthew 7:1-6
[Do Not Judge] "Do not judge so that you will not be judged. For by the standard you judge you will be judged, and the measure you use will be the measure you receive. Why do you see the speck in your brother's eye, but fail to see the beam of wood in your own?  Or how can you say to your brother, 'Let me remove the speck from your eye,' while there is a beam in your own?  You hypocrite! First remove the beam from your own eye, and then you can see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye.  Do not give what is holy to dogs or throw your pearls before pigs; otherwise they will trample them under their feet and turn around and tear you to pieces."

v
Matthew 7:7-11
[Ask, Seek, Knock] "Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened for you. For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened. Is there anyone among you who, if his son asks for bread, will give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a snake?  If you then, although you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good gifts to those who ask him! 

v
Matthew 7:12
In everything, treat others as you would want them to treat you, for this fulfills the law and the prophets."

v
Romans 8:32
Indeed, he who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all---how will he not also, along with him, freely give us all things?

v
Romans 8:37
No, in all these things we have complete victory through him who loved us!

v
1 Cor 1:20
For every one of God's promises are "Yes" in him (the Son of God, Jesus Christ); therefore also through him the "Amen" is spoken, to the glory we give to God.

v
Ehpesians 1:3
Blessed is the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly realms in Christ.

v
Zechariah 4:6
'Not by strength and not by power, but by my Spirit,' says the Lord who rules over all."

v
Romans 8:28
And we know that all things work together32 for good for those who love God
