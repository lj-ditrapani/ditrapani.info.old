Hebrews 9 Part B
========================================================================

Last week we went through the first half of Hebrews 9.
We'll start this week by re-reading the first 15 verses of Hebrews.
Then we'll go over verses 16-28 in more detail.

{"verse": "Hebrews 9:1-15"}
1 The **former system** had instructions as to how to worship, and an
**earthly** sanctuary.
2 The first room in the tabernacle housed the candlestick, the table,
and the **sacred bread**. This was called the **Holy Place**.
3 Past the second **veil** in the tabernacle was the room called the
**Most Holy Place**.
4 This contained the golden altar of incense, the gold-covered
"**agreement chest**." Inside this were the golden pot containing
manna, Aaron's rod that had produced buds, and the stone inscriptions of
the agreement.
5 Above this were the glorious angel cherubim covering the place of
**reconciliation**. We can't discuss all of this in detail now.
6 Once all of this had been set up, the priests would go in regularly to
the first room of the tabernacle to perform their duties.
7 But only the high priest went into the second room, and only once a
year. Even then he had to make a sacrifice involving **blood**, which he
offered for himself and for the people's sins of ignorance.
8 By this **the Holy Spirit** indicated that the way into the true
**Most Holy Place** hadn't been revealed while the first tabernacle
still existed.
9 This is an illustration for us in the present, showing us that the
gifts and sacrifices that are offered **can't** make the worshiper's
**conscience clear**.
10 They're just religious regulations---about food and drink,
and various ceremonies involving washing---which were put in place
until the time of God's new way of relating to him.
11 Christ has come as a **high priest** of all the good experiences we
now have. He went into the greater, more complete tabernacle that wasn't
made by human hands---not part of this created world.
12 He didn't enter through the blood of goats and calves, but through
his **own blood**. He entered once, for **all time**, into the
**Most Holy Place, setting us free forever**.
13 For if the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a cow sprinkled
on those who are ritually unclean make the body ceremonially clean,
14 how much more does the blood of Christ---who offered himself in his
**sinless life** to God through the eternal Spirit---**clean your
consciences** from your past sinful lives so you can **serve the living
God**?
15 This is why he is the mediator of **a new agreed relationship**.
Since a death has occurred to **set them free from the sins committed**
under the first agreed relationship, now those who are called can
**receive the promise of an eternal inheritance**.


Don't listen to those who try to make you sin conscience and give you a
guilty conscience.  It is not God's will for you to have a guilty
conscience, but a pure conscience.  It is not God's will for you to be
sin-conscience, it is God's will for you to be Christ conscience.


{"verse": "Hebrews 9:16-17"}
16 For a will to be implemented, the person who made it must be dead.
17 A will is only valid when there's been a death---and is never
applied while the person who made it is still alive.

Jesus had to die to unleash the power of his will.

{"verse": "Hebrews 9:18-20"}
18 That's why the first agreement was established with blood.
19 After Moses had given all the commandments of the law to everyone,
he took the blood of calves and goats, and together with water, scarlet
wool, and hyssop, sprinkled the book itself and all the people.
20 He said to them, "This is the blood of the agreed relationship that
God has told you he wants with you."

God's covenants are established with blood.  Everything under the old
covenant was sprinkled with blood as a picture of what Jesus would do to
establish the new covenant.  It was necessary for Jesus to die and shed
his blood so he could pay for our sins and make us right with God.

{"verse": "Hebrews 9:21-22"}
21 Moses sprinkled the blood in the same way on the tabernacle and
everything used in worship.
22 According to ceremonial law, almost everything is made clean with
blood, and **without shedding blood nothing is made ritually free from
the stain of sin.**

Things sprinkled with blood under the old covenant:
- The book
- All the people
- The tabernacle
- Everything used in worship

The blood cleansing under the old covenant is just a picture of Jesus'
blood cleansing us from all our sins.

{"verse": "Hebrews 9:23"}
23 So if the copies of what is in heaven needed to be cleansed in this
way, the things in heaven needed cleansing by better sacrifices.

We needed something greater than the blood of bulls and goats to cleans
us of our sins and make us right with God.
The blood of bulls and goats cleansed the Israelites bodies.  But the
blood of Jesus cleanses our conscience so we can come close to God.

{"verse": "Hebrews 9:24"}
24 For Christ hasn't entered a Most Holy Place constructed by human
beings that is only a pattern of the original. He has entered heaven
itself, and now appears on our behalf, speaking for us in God's
presence.

The earthly holy-of-holies was just a picture of the heavenly one.
Jesus entered the "true" holy-of-holies in heaven---directly into God's
throne room---on our behalf.

{"verse": "Hebrews 9:25-26"}
25 This was not to repeatedly offer himself, like a high priest has to
enter the Most Holy Place year after year, offering blood that is not
his own.
26 Otherwise Christ would have had to suffer many times since the
creation of the world. No: **just this one time** at the end of the
present age he came **to remove sin by sacrificing himself**.

Jesus paid for all our sins once and for all.  It is a finished work.
You can be certain God will never bring up your sins again.

{"verse": "Hebrews 9:27-28"}
27 Just as human beings only die once, and then are judged,
28 so too for Christ---having been sacrificed once **to take away the
sins of many people**, he will come again, **not to deal with sin**,
but to **save** those who wait for him.

Jesus is not returning to judge you but to save you.  He is done with
dealing with sin.  He dealt with it **ALL** on the cross.  He is only
returning to bring you to full salvation.  If you have faith and trust
in Jesus.  Then you have nothing to fear about His return.  Actually,
you can be happy and excited when Jesus returns, because it means only
good news for you.

{"verse": "Colossians 2:8-23"}
8 Watch out that nobody enslaves you through their philosophy and
worthless delusions, following human traditions and concepts of this
world, and not following Christ.
9 For the fullness of God's divine nature lives in Christ in bodily
form,
10 and you have been made full in him. He is supreme over every ruler
and authority.
11 You were "circumcised" in him but not by human hands. You have been
set free from sinful human nature by the "circumcision" Christ
performed.
12 You were buried with him in baptism, and you were raised with him
through your trust in what God did by raising him from the dead.
13 And even though you were dead because of your sins and being
physically "uncircumcised," he brought you to life together with him.
He has forgiven us all our sins.
14 He wiped out the record of our debts according to the Law that was
written down against us; he took away this barrier by nailing it to the
cross.
15 He stripped away the power of spiritual rulers and authorities, and
having publicly revealed what they were truly like, he led them captive
behind him in victory.
16 So don't let anyone criticize you for what you eat or what you drink,
or what religious festivals you choose to observe.
17 These are just a shadow of what was to come, for the physical reality
is Christ.
18 Don't let anyone cheat you out of your prize by insisting you have to
beat yourself, or worship angels.  They think they are better than
anyone else because of visions they say they've had, and become
ridiculously conceited in their sinful minds.
19 Such people are not connected to the head that directs the body,
nourished and joined together through the body's sinews and muscles. As
the body is united together it grows the way God wants it to grow.
20 If you died with Christ to the religious demands that this world
insists upon, why would you make yourself subject to such demands as if
you were still part of this world?
21 Things like: don't handle that, don't taste that, don't touch that!
22 These commands refer to things that don't last since they're used
up, and they're based on man-made requirements and teachings.
23 Such rules may make some kind of sense to those who practice
self-centered piety, who are so proud of being humble, and who "mortify
the body;" but in reality they don't help at all in dealing with sinful
desires.
