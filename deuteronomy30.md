Jesus Revealed in Deuteronomy 30

v
Romans 10:6-13
But the righteousness based on faith [imputed by God and bringing right relationship with Him] says, *Do not say in your heart, Who will ascend into Heaven? that is, to bring Christ down; Or who will descend into the abyss? that is, to bring Christ up from the dead [as if we could be saved by our own efforts]. But what does it say? The Word (God's message in Christ) is near you, on your lips and in your heart*; that is, the Word (the message, the basis and object) of faith which we preach, Because if you acknowledge and confess with your lips that Jesus is Lord and in your heart believe (adhere to, trust in, and rely on the truth) that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.  For with the heart a person believes (adheres to, trusts in, and relies on Christ) and so is justified (declared righteous, acceptable to God), and with the mouth he confesses (declares openly and speaks out freely his faith) and confirms [his] salvation.  The Scripture says, No man who believes in Him [who adheres to, relies on, and trusts in Him] will [ever] be put to shame or be disappointed. [No one] for there is no distinction between Jew and Greek. The same Lord is Lord over all [of us] and He generously bestows His riches upon all who call upon Him [in faith].  For everyone who calls upon the name of the Lord [invoking Him as Lord] will be saved.

v
Deuteronomy 30:11-14
For this commandment which I command you this day is not too difficult for you, nor is it far off.  It is not [a secret laid up] in heaven, that you should say, Who shall go up for us to heaven and bring it to us, that we may hear and do it?  Neither is it beyond the sea, that you should say, Who shall go over the sea for us and bring it to us, that we may hear and do it?  But the word is very near you, in your mouth and in your mind and in your heart, so that you can do it.

God did not delight in blessing Isreal under the old covenant of the law, but He delights to bless under the new covenant of Jesus Christ.

v
Deuteronomy 30:9
And the Lord your God will make you abundantly prosperous in every work of your hand, in the fruit of your body, of your cattle, of your land, for good; for *the Lord will again delight in prospering you*, as He took delight in your fathers,
