Leave the Old Covenant Behind and Come To Jesus
========================================================================

What does the law (old covenant) say?  Do not murder, do not steal, honor your parents, etc.  On whom does the burden of fulfilling the old covenant depend on?  It depends on man.  All of the commandments are directed at men, not God.  The old covenant is based on man's ability to perform a set of "do's" and "don'ts" by relying on his self effort (his flesh).  In other words, it is works-based.  How many commandments must man keep to be blessed?  All of them.  And how often must he keep all of the commandments?  All of the time.  How many commandments can man break until he becomes cursed?  One.  How many times can he break that ONE command before he becomes cursed?  Once.  

We know we are not perfect and all of us have sinned, so does that mean we are cursed under the law?  Yes!  That is why the bible says:

{"verse": "Galatians 3:10"}
"For all who rely on doing the **works** of the **law** are under a **curse**..."

So don't deceive yourself into believing you can be successful under the old covenant.

What hope do we have then?  We have a great hope indeed!  

{"verse": "Galatians 3:13"}
"Christ **redeemed** us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us, for it is written: "Cursed is everyone who is hung on a tree."

We have a new and better covenant.  The success of the old covenant depended on our self effort---it was works-based (that's why it failed.)  But the success of the new covenant is dependant ONLY on Jesus' work at the cross!  Hallelujah!  The new covenant is not work-based, but faith-based!  Believe it!

{"verse": "Galatians 3:14"}
"in order that in Christ Jesus the **blessing** of Abraham would come to the Gentiles, so that we could receive the promise of the Spirit by **faith**."

So you see that the blessings come strictly by confessing Jesus is Lord and believing in your hart that God raised Him from the dead.

{"verse": "Romans 10:10-13"}
"For with the heart one believes and thus has righteousness and with the mouth one confesses and thus has salvation. For the scripture says, "Everyone who believes in him will not be put to shame." For there is no distinction between the Jew and the Greek, for the same Lord is Lord of all, who **richly blesses all who call on him**. For everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved."

What is the context of Galatians?  Galatians was written to gentiles who accepted Christ by faith, but then later, began adopting the Jewish religion and went back to the works-based old covenant.  They were trying to earn righteousness by doing the works of the law.  Here is the first part of Galatians 3 so you can read it in its proper context and enjoy it for your self:

{"verse": "Galatians 3:1-5"}
3:1 You foolish Galatians! Who has cast a spell on you? Before your eyes **Jesus Christ** was vividly portrayed as **crucified**! 3:2 The only thing I want to learn from you is this: Did you receive the Spirit by doing the **works of the law** or by **believing what you heard**? 3:3 Are you so foolish? Although you began with the **Spirit**, are you now trying to finish by **human effort**? 3:4 Have you suffered so many things for nothing?---if indeed it was for nothing. 3:5 Does God then give you the Spirit and work miracles among you by your **doing the works of the law** or by your **believing what you heard**?

{"verse": "Galatians 3:6-14"}
3:6 Just as Abraham **believed** God, and it was credited to him as **righteousness**, 3:7 so then, understand that those who **believe** are the sons of Abraham. 3:8 And the scripture, foreseeing that God would **justify** the Gentiles by **faith**, proclaimed the gospel to Abraham ahead of time, saying, "All the nations will be **blessed** in you." 3:9 So then those who **believe** are **blessed** along with Abraham the believer. 3:10 For all who rely on doing the works of the law are under a curse, because it is written, "Cursed is everyone who does not keep on doing everything written in the book of the law." 3:11 Now it is clear **no one is justified before God by the law, because the righteous one will live by faith**. 3:12 But the law is not based on faith, but the one who does the works of the law will live by them. 3:13 Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us (because it is written, "Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree") 3:14 in order that in Christ Jesus the blessing of Abraham would come to the Gentiles, so that we could receive the promise of the Spirit by faith.
