Hebrews 2
========================================================================

{"verse": "Hebrews 2:1"}
So we should pay even closer attention to what we've learned so we don't drift away from it.

See Chapt 1 on why we should pay even closer attention to the Good News of Jesus Christ.

The message that the Lord gave us is the salvation message;  the Good News of Jesus Christ.  It is a message of grace because we did nothing and can do nothing to earn this salvation.  He died for us while we were still sinners; God's enemies and children of wrath.

{"verse": "Hebrews 2:2-3"}
2 If the message the angels brought was trustworthy, and every sin and disobedient act brings its own consequence, 3 how will we escape if we don't pay attention to this great **salvation** that the Lord first announced, and then we had confirmed to us by those who heard him.

God confirms this salvation message through miracles and gifts of the Holy Spirit (not because we earned them through works of the law).  Notice, they are **gifts** of the Holy Spirit, not rewards.

{"verse": "Hebrews 2:4"}
God also testified through signs and miracles, by acts that show his power, and by the **gifts** of the Holy Spirit, given as he chose.

Verse 9 makes it very clear that this is all about the salvation message.  Jesus experienced death for everyone.

{"verse": "Hebrews 2:5-9"}
5 It's not angels who will be in charge of the world to come that we're talking about. 6 But as it's been said, "What are human beings that you should worry about them? What is a son of man that you should care about him? 7 You set him a little lower than the angels; you crowned him with glory and honor, and placed him over all your creation. 8 You gave him authority over everything." Nothing was left out when God gave him authority over everything. However we see that not everything is subject to his authority yet.  **9 But we see Jesus, placed a little lower than the angels, through the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor. Through God’s grace Jesus experienced death for everyone.**

{"verse": "Hebrews 2:10"}
10 It was appropriate that God, who creates and maintains everything, should **bring many of his children to glory**, and to completely prepare through suffering **the one who leads them to salvation**.


Jesus makes you Holy and you are being made Holy.  You do **NOT** make yourself holy by your works.  Jesus is not ashamed of you when you have faith in Him because he has cleansed you already.

{"verse": "Hebrews 2:11-12"}
11 For both **the one who makes people holy and those who are made holy** belong to the same family. That is he doesn't hesitate to call them "brothers," 12 saying "I will announce your name to my brothers; I will praise you among your people when they meet together."

So trust in Jesus!

{"verse": "Hebrews 2:13"}
13 Also: **"I will place my trust in him,"** and "Here I am, together with the children God has given to me."

Everyone who is not living by faith is in bondage to the fear of death.  Jesus came to set us free from that fear.  In Christ we have true freedom to live the abundant life that He freely gives us.

{"verse": "Hebrews 2:14-15"}
14 Because the children share flesh and blood in common, he shared in this in the same way so that **through death he could destroy the one that had the power of death—the devil— 15 and free everyone who through fear of death were enslaved all their lives.**

Jesus came to earth in the flesh so he could earn the right to identify with us and become our high priest.  He did it all for us because of His great love for us.  As our high priest, he brought about the forgiveness of our sins through the cross.

{"verse": "Hebrews 2:16-17"}
16 Of course it's not angels he's concerned about; he's concerned to help the children of Abraham.  17 That's why it was necessary for him to become like his brothers in everything, so that he could become **a merciful and trustworthy high priest** in the things of God, to **forgive his people’s sins**.

Jesus came to save those who have faith in Him.  Because if you are Christ's, then you are a true child of Abraham.

{"verse": "Galatians 3:26 and 29"}
26 For you are all God's children through your trust in Christ Jesus.  29 If you are Christ's, then you are Abraham's children, and you are heirs of the promise!

Today, Jesus is our great help.

{"verse": "Hebrews 2:18"}
18 Because he himself suffered when he was tempted, **he is able to help those who are tempted**.
