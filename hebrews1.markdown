Hebrews 1
========================================================================
Jesus is greater than the prophets.

{"verse": "Hebrews 1:1-2"}
IN MANY separate revelations [each of which set forth a portion of the Truth] and in different ways God spoke of old to [our] forefathers in and by the prophets, [But] in the last of these days He has spoken to us in [the person of a] Son, Whom He appointed Heir and lawful Owner of all things, also by and through Whom He created the worlds and the reaches of space and the ages of time [He made, produced, built, operated, and arranged them in order].

- Jesus is the sole expression of the glory of God
- He holds the universe together
- He cleansed us of our sins **AND** guilt
- He is seated at God's right hand

{"verse": "Hebrews 1:3"}
He is **the sole expression of the glory of God** [the Light-being, the out-raying or radiance of the divine], and He is the perfect imprint and very image of [God's] nature, upholding and **maintaining** and guiding and propelling **the universe by His mighty word of power**. When He had by offering Himself **accomplished our cleansing of sins and riddance of guilt**, He sat down at the right hand of the divine Majesty on high,

Jesus is superior to the angels.  He is God's son.  No angel is God's child.

{"verse": "Hebrews 1:5"}
For to which of the angels did [God] ever say, You are My Son, today I have begotten You [established You in an official Sonship relation, with kingly dignity]? And again, I will be to Him a Father, and He will be to Me a Son? [II Sam. 7:14; Ps. 2:7.]

God always seeks to bring joy in our lives.  He is not a God of suffering, but a God of Joy.  God is always smiling down on you because you believe and have faith in his son Jesus.

{"verse": "Hebrews 1:9"}
...Therefore God, [even] Your God (Godhead), has anointed You with the oil of exultant joy and gladness above and beyond Your companions.

God created the world through Jesus.  Jesus was the one who actually executed the creation of the Earth and everything in it.

{"verse": "Hebrews 1:10"}
And [further], You, Lord, did lay the foundation of the earth in the beginning, and the heavens are the works of Your hands.

{"verse": "John 1:3"}
All things were made and came into existence through Him; and without Him was not even one thing made that has come into being.

Under the new covenant, angels are servants to those who have faith in Jesus.

{"verse": "Hebrews 1:14"}
Are not the angels all ministering spirits (servants) sent out in the service [of God for the assistance] of those who are to inherit salvation?

Your job is to believe in Jesus and receive the righteousness that comes by faith.

{"verse": "John 6:28-29"}
So then they said to him, "What must we do to accomplish the deeds God requires?"  Jesus replied, "This is the deed God requires -- to believe in the one whom he sent."
