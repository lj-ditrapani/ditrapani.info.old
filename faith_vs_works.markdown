Justification by Faith not by Works
===================================

God requires us to live by faith alone and never by works.  He requires us to trust in and depend on the work of Jesus Christ to put us in right relationship with Him and never to depend on our own works.  This is absolutely fundamental to having a right relationship with your heavenly father.  In the following scriptures, the Lord expresses his absolute, definite and unbending point of view on this matter.

{"verse": "Galatians 2:16"}
Yet we know that a man is justified or reckoned righteous and in right standing with God **not by works** of the Law, but [only] through **faith** and [absolute] reliance on and adherence to and **trust** in Jesus Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed One). [Therefore] even we [ourselves] have believed on Christ Jesus, in order to be **justified by faith** in Christ and **not by works of the Law** [for we cannot be justified by any observance of the ritual of the Law given by Moses], because by keeping legal rituals and by works no human being can ever be justified (declared righteous and put in right standing with God).

{"verse": "Galatians 3:12"}
But the **Law does not rest on faith** [does not require faith, has nothing to do with faith], for it itself says, He who does them [the things prescribed by the Law] shall live by them [not by faith].

{"verse": "Galatians 5:4-5"}
4 If you seek to be justified and declared righteous and to be given a right standing with God through the Law, **you are brought to nothing and so separated (severed) from Christ**. You have fallen away from grace (from God's gracious favor and unmerited blessing).  5 For we, [**not relying on the Law** but] through the [Holy] Spirit's [help], by **faith** anticipate and wait for the blessing and good for which our righteousness and right standing with God [our conformity to His will in purpose, thought, and action, causes us] to hope.

{"verse": "Romans 3:20"}
For no person will be justified (made righteous, acquitted, and judged acceptable) in His sight **by observing the works prescribed by the Law**. For [the real function of] the Law is to make men recognize and be **conscious of sin** [not mere perception, but an acquaintance with sin which works toward repentance, faith, and holy character].

{"verse": "Romans 3:28"}
For we hold that a man is justified and made upright by **faith independent of and distinctly apart from good deeds (works of the Law)**. [The observance of the Law has nothing to do with justification.]

{"verse": "Romans 4:5"}
But to one who, **not working [by the Law]**, trusts (believes fully) in Him Who justifies the ungodly, his **faith** is credited to him as righteousness (the standing acceptable to God).

{"verse": "Romans 4:13"}
For the promise to Abraham or his posterity, that he should inherit the world, did not come through **[observing the commands of] the Law** but through the **righteousness of faith**.

{"verse": "Romans 4:16"}
Therefore, [inheriting] the promise is the outcome of **faith** and depends [**entirely**] on **faith**, in order that it might be given as an act of grace (unmerited favor), to make it stable and valid and **guaranteed** to all his descendants--not only to the devotees and adherents of the Law, but also to those who share the faith of Abraham, who is [thus] the father of us all.

{"verse": "Romans 5:1-2"}
Therefore, since we are justified (acquitted, declared righteous, and given a right standing with God) through **faith**, let us [grasp the fact that we] have [the peace of reconciliation to hold and to enjoy] peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed One).  Through Him also we have [our] access (entrance, introduction) by **faith** into this grace (state of God's favor) in which we [firmly and safely] stand. And let us rejoice and exult in our hope of experiencing and enjoying the glory of God.

{"verse": "Romans 9:30-33"}
30 What shall we say then? That Gentiles who did not follow after righteousness [who did not seek salvation by right relationship to God] have attained it by faith [a righteousness imputed by God, based on and produced by faith], 31 Whereas Israel, though ever in pursuit of a **law** [for the securing] of righteousness (right standing with God), actually **did not succeed in fulfilling the Law**. 32 For what reason? Because [they pursued it] **not through faith, relying [instead] on the merit of their works** [**they did not depend on faith but on what they could do**]. They have stumbled over the Stumbling Stone. 33 As it is written, Behold I am laying in Zion a Stone that will make men stumble, a Rock that will make them fall; but he who **believes** in Him [who adheres to, **trusts** in, and relies on Him] shall not be put to shame nor be disappointed in his expectations.

{"verse": "Romans 11:6"}
But if it is by grace (His unmerited favor and graciousness), it is no longer conditioned on works or anything men have done. Otherwise, grace would no longer be grace [it would be meaningless].

Justification by faith alone and not by works is not a "doctrinal" issue to be argued about.  It is a cut-and-dry fact.
