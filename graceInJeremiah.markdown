Grace in Jeremiah
========================================================================


{"verse": "Jeremiah 17:5-8"}
Thus says the Lord: **Cursed [with great evil]** is the strong man **who
trusts in and relies on frail man, making weak [human] flesh his arm,
and whose mind and heart turn aside from the Lord**.
For he shall be like a shrub or a person naked and destitute in the
desert; and he shall not see any good come, but shall dwell in the
parched places in the wilderness, in an uninhabited salt land.
**[Most] blessed** is the man **who believes in, trusts in, and relies on the
Lord, and whose hope and confidence the Lord is**.
For he shall be like a tree planted by the waters that spreads out its
roots by the river; and it shall not see and fear when heat comes; but
its leaf shall be green. It shall not be anxious and full of care in the
year of drought, nor shall it cease yielding fruit.
