NET False
Cleansed, Sanctified, and Justified

1 Corinthians 6:9-10 used to cause me great fear when I would read it.  I would think that I really need to be on my guard and ensure I don't sin so I won't go to hell!

v
1 Cor 6:9-10 (NET)
Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived! The sexually immoral, idolaters, adulterers, passive homosexual partners, practicing homosexuals, thieves, the greedy, drunkards, the verbally abusive, and swindlers will not inherit the kingdom of God.

Since I received the revelation of the gospel of Jesus Christ, I've had peace in my heart.  I know my righteousness is rapped up in the perfect person, Jesus Christ, the son of God and my savior!  The other day I was telling my wife how the above verse made me so scared because I was afraid of going to hell.  She told me I need to read verse 11 (thank God for giving me such a beautiful and wise wife).

v
1 Cor 6:11 (NET)
 Some of you once lived this way. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God.

That sounds nice.  But what does it really mean?  What if I have not been washed?  Let's look at the amplified version to see if we can get a more complete picture of what the Lord is telling us.

v
1 Cor 6:11 (Amplified Bible)
And such some of you were [once]. But you were washed clean (purified by a complete atonement for sin and made free from the guilt of sin), and you were consecrated (set apart, hallowed), and you were justified [pronounced righteous, by trusting] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the [Holy] Spirit of our God.

Wow! Now that is amazing.  It really doesn't leave any room for doubt does it?  Jesus' work on the cross is truly a finished work!  He paid the price for our sins once and for all!  Through him, many sinners were made righteous.  Hallelujah!  Amen!

v
Matthew 7:21-23
"Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter into the kingdom of heaven---only the one who does the will of my Father in heaven. On that day, many will say to me, 'Lord, Lord, didn't we prophesy in your name, and in your name cast out demons and do many powerful deeds?' Then I will declare to them, 'I never knew you. Go away from me, you lawbreakers!'

<!--verses that say righteousness is a free gift from God through faith in Jesus Christ-->
