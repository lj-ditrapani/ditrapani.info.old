What does it mean to be a living sacrifice?

v
Romans 12:1
Therefore I exhort you, brothers and sisters, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a sacrifice---alive, holy, and pleasing to God---which is your reasonable service.

In what manner must we be living sacrifices?  Alive, holy and pleasing to God.  We must have faith to please God.

v
Hebrews 11:6
Now without faith it is impossible to please him, for the one who approaches God must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him.

Romans 6 also talks about presenting your body to God.

v
Romans 6:11-14
 So you too consider yourselves dead to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus.  Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you obey its desires, and do not present your members to sin as instruments to be used for unrighteousness, but present yourselves to God as those who are alive from the dead and your members to God as instruments to be used for righteousness.  For sin will have no mastery over you, because you are not under law but under grace.

Holy means being set apart.  We are set apart and made holy by the blood of Jesus.

v
1 Cor 6:11
And such some of you were [once]. But you were washed clean (purified by a complete atonement for sin and made free from the guilt of sin), and you were consecrated (set apart, hallowed), and you were justified [pronounced righteous, by trusting] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the [Holy] Spirit of our God.

v
Hebrews 4:11
Thus we must make every effort to enter that rest, so that no one may fall by following the same pattern of disobedience.

v
Romans 5:17
For if, by the transgression of the one man, death reigned through the one, how much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one, Jesus Christ!

v
Romans 6:4
Therefore we have been buried with him through baptism into death, in order that just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we too may live a new life.

v
Romans 6:1-4
6:1 What shall we say then? Are we to remain in sin so that grace may increase? 6:2 Absolutely not! How can we who died to sin still live in it? 6:3 Or do you not know that as many as were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? 6:4 Therefore we have been buried with him through baptism into death, in order that just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we too may live a new life.1

v
Matthew 7:21-23
"Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter into the kingdom of heaven---only the one who does the will of my Father in heaven. On that day, many will say to me, 'Lord, Lord, didn't we prophesy in your name, and in your name cast out demons and do many powerful deeds?' Then I will declare to them, 'I never knew you. Go away from me, you lawbreakers!'

v
Matthew 7:21-23 (Amplified)
Not everyone who says to Me, Lord, Lord, will enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of My Father Who is in heaven.  Many will say to Me on that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in Your name and driven out demons in Your name and done many mighty works in Your name?  And then I will say to them openly (publicly), I never knew you; depart from Me, you who act wickedly [disregarding My commands].
