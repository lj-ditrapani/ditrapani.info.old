Laziness is Unbelief
========================================================================

{"verse": "Matthew 25:26"}
"His master replied, 'You wicked, lazy servant! So you knew that I harvest where I have not sown and gather where I have not scattered seed?'"

{"verse": "Hebrews 6:12"}
We do not want you to become lazy, but to imitate those who through faith and patience inherit what has been promised.

{"verse": "Exodus 5:8"}
But require them to make the same number of bricks as before; don't reduce the quota. They are lazy; that is why they are crying out, 'Let us go and sacrifice to our God.'

{"verse": "Exodus 5:17"}
Pharaoh said, "Lazy, that's what you are---lazy! That is why you keep saying, 'Let us go and sacrifice to the Lord.'

{"verse": "Titus 1"}
For there are many rebellious people, full of meaningless talk and deception, especially those of the circumcision group. They must be silenced, because they are disrupting whole households by teaching things they ought not to teach---and that for the sake of dishonest gain. One of Crete's own prophets has said it: "Cretans are always liars, evil brutes, lazy gluttons." This saying is true. Therefore rebuke them sharply, so that they will be sound in the faith and will pay no attention to Jewish myths or to the merely human commands of those who reject the truth. To the pure, all things are pure, but to those who are corrupted and do not believe, nothing is pure. In fact, both their minds and consciences are corrupted. They claim to know God, but by their actions they deny him. They are detestable, disobedient and unfit for doing anything good.

{"verse": "Hebrews 6:11-12"}
But we passionately want each of you to demonstrate the same eagerness for the fulfillment of your hope until the end, so that you may not be sluggish, but imitators of those who through faith and perseverance inherit the promises.

The work of a new covenant believer is to believe, receive, and speak.

{"verse": "Philippians 4:19"}
And my God will supply every need of yours according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus.

{"verse": "Proverbs 6:6-11"}
Go to the ant, you sluggard; consider its ways and be wise!  It has no commander, no overseer or ruler, yet it stores its provisions in summer and gathers its food at harvest.  How long will you lie there, you sluggard?  When will you get up from your sleep?  A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest- and poverty will come on you like a bandit and scarcity like an armed man.

{"verse": "Proverbs 10:4"}
Lazy hands make for poverty, but diligent hands bring wealth.

{"verse": "Proverbs 12:27"}
The lazy do not roast any game, but the diligent feed on the riches of the hunt.

{"verse": "Proverbs 26:13-16"}
The sluggard says, "There is a lion in the road!  A lion in the streets!" Like a door that turns on its hinges, so a sluggard turns on his bed.  The sluggard plunges his hand in the dish; he is too lazy to bring it back to his mouth.  The sluggard is wiser in his own estimation than seven people who respond with good sense.
