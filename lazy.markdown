Laziness is Unbelief
========================================================================

{"verse": "Matthew 25:26"}
"His master replied, 'You wicked, lazy servant! So you knew that I harvest where I have not sown and gather where I have not scattered seed?'"

{"verse": "Hebrews 6:12"}
We do not want you to become lazy, but to imitate those who through faith and patience inherit what has been promised.

{"verse": "Exodus 5:8"}
But require them to make the same number of bricks as before; don't reduce the quota. They are lazy; that is why they are crying out, 'Let us go and sacrifice to our God.'

{"verse": "Exodus 5:17"}
Pharaoh said, "Lazy, that's what you are---lazy! That is why you keep saying, 'Let us go and sacrifice to the Lord.'

{"verse": "Titus 1:10-16"}
For there are many rebellious people, full of meaningless talk and deception, especially **those of the circumcision group**. They must be silenced, because they are disrupting whole households by teaching things they ought not to teach---and that for the sake of dishonest gain. One of Crete's own prophets has said it: "Cretans are always liars, evil brutes, lazy gluttons." This saying is true. Therefore rebuke them sharply, so that they will **be sound in the faith** and will pay no attention to Jewish myths or to the **merely human commands** of those who reject the truth. To the pure, all things are pure, but to those who are corrupted and **do not believe**, nothing is pure. In fact, both their minds and **consciences** are corrupted. They claim to know God, but by their actions they deny him. They are detestable, disobedient and unfit for doing anything good.

{"verse": "Hebrews 6:11-12"}
But we passionately want each of you to demonstrate the same eagerness for the fulfillment of your hope until the end, so that you may not be sluggish, but imitators of those who through faith and perseverance inherit the promises.

The work of a new covenant believer is to believe, receive, and speak.

{"verse": "Philippians 4:19"}
And my God will supply every need of yours according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus.

FBV Titus 1:10-16

10 For there are many rebels around who talk a lot of deceptive nonsense, especially from the **circumcision** group. 11 Their talking must stop, these people who throw whole families into turmoil, teaching things that aren’t right for the sake of making money. 12 As someone of their own people, a prophet, has stated, “Cretans are always liars, evil beasts who are lazy, greedy people.” 13 This is a true statement! Consequently give them a good telling-off so that they can have a healthy **trust** in God, 14 not paying attention to Jewish myths and **human commandments** from those who deviate from the **truth**. 15 To those who have clean minds everything is clean, but to those who are corrupt and refuse to **trust** in God, nothing is clean—both their minds and their consciences are corrupt. 16They claim to know God, but they prove this is false by what they do. They are detestable and disobedient, worthless for doing anything good.


Amplified Titus 1:10-16

    10For there are many disorderly and unruly men who are idle (vain, empty) and misleading talkers and self-deceivers and deceivers of others. [This is true] especially of those of the **circumcision** party [who have come over from **Judaism**].

    11Their mouths must be stopped, for they are mentally distressing and subverting whole families by teaching what they ought not to teach, for the purpose of getting base advantage and disreputable gain.

    12One of their [very] number, a prophet of their own, said, Cretans are always liars, hurtful beasts, idle and lazy gluttons.

    13And this account of them is [really] true. Because it is [true], rebuke them sharply [deal sternly, even severely with them], so that they may be sound in the **faith** and free from error,

    14[And may show their soundness by] ceasing to give attention to Jewish myths and fables or to **rules** [laid down] by [mere] men who reject and turn their backs on the **Truth**.

    15To the pure [in heart and conscience] all things are pure, but to the defiled and corrupt and unbelieving nothing is pure; their very minds and consciences are defiled and polluted.

    16They profess to know God [to recognize, perceive, and be acquainted with Him], but deny and disown and renounce Him by what they do; they are detestable and loathsome, **unbelieving** and disobedient and disloyal and rebellious, and [they are] unfit and worthless for good work (deed or enterprise) of any kind.


{"verse": "Proverbs 6:6-11"}
Go to the ant, you sluggard; consider its ways and be wise!  It has no commander, no overseer or ruler, yet it stores its provisions in summer and gathers its food at harvest.  How long will you lie there, you sluggard?  When will you get up from your sleep?  A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest- and poverty will come on you like a bandit and scarcity like an armed man.

{"verse": "Proverbs 10:4"}
Lazy hands make for poverty, but diligent hands bring wealth.

{"verse": "Proverbs 12:27"}
The lazy do not roast any game, but the diligent feed on the riches of the hunt.

{"verse": "Proverbs 26:13-16"}
The sluggard says, "There is a lion in the road!  A lion in the streets!" Like a door that turns on its hinges, so a sluggard turns on his bed.  The sluggard plunges his hand in the dish; he is too lazy to bring it back to his mouth.  The sluggard is wiser in his own estimation than seven people who respond with good sense.
