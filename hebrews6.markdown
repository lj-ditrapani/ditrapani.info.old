Hebrews 6
========================================================================

This chapter is about the great hope we have in Christ.

From chapter 5 we saw the foundational teaching is the righteousness that comes by faith and not by doing the works of the law.

{"verse": "Hebrews 6:1-3"}
1 So let's not get stuck on the basic teachings about Christ, but let's progress to a more mature understanding. We don't need to go over again the ideas of repenting from what we used to do, about trusting in God--- 2 or teachings about baptism, the laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment. 3 So let's get on with it, as God gives us the opportunity!

I believe this is referring to the Hebrews who heard the good news but rejected Christ and went back to the old covenant depending on their works to save them.  We will see more of this in later chapters (Hebrews 10:18, 10:26-29).

The thing they experienced and rejected was the "heavenly gift".  It is a gift, not something they earned.  They didn't do anything to receive it, and they didn't do anything to lose it.  They just rejected it.  The amplified bible, in verse 6, says that they "deviate from the faith" instead of abandon God.  In other words, they stopped believing.  I does not say they deviated from the law.  We know that living by faith and living by works are at ends with each other.

{"verse": "Hebrews 6:4-6"}
4 It's impossible for those who once understood and experienced God's heavenly **gift**---who shared in receiving the Holy Spirit, 5 who had known God's good word and the power of the coming age--- 6 and then completely abandon God, for them to be brought back to repentance once more. They themselves have crucified the Son of God all over again and publicly humiliated him.

Notice that the land only needs to receive the rain.  In the same way, we only need to receive God's spirit, favor, and grace through faith in Jesus.  The fruit will come on its own.  But if we try to work out of our flesh instead, we only produce sin.

{"verse": "Hebrews 6:7-8"}
7 Land that has been watered by rain, and produces crops for those who farm it, has God's blessing. 8 But land that only produces weeds and thorns is worthless, and is about to be condemned. In the end all that can be done is to burn it.

{"verse": "Hebrews 6:9"}
9 But dear friends, we believe better of you and your salvation, even if we talk like this!

{"verse": "Hebrews 6:10"}
10 God wouldn't be so unjust as to forget what you've done and the love you've shown for him by the care you've shown for fellow-believers—something you’re still doing.

In the amplified bible, verse 11 starts with "But".  Meaning, although God remembers the Hebrews \works under the old covenant, what he really wants is for them take hold of this hope they have in Christ.  He wants their hope to be based on Christ, not on their own works.

{"verse": "Hebrews 6:11"}
11 We want each of you to show the same kind of commitment, confident in God's hope until it's fulfilled.

We inherit the promise by trusting God, not by trying to earn it by good works.  God's idea of laziness is when we fail to have faith in Jesus, not when we fail to do the works of the law.

The amplified version says "12 In order that you may not grow disinterested and become [spiritual] sluggards, but imitators, behaving as do those who through **faith** (by their leaning of the entire personality on God in Christ in absolute trust and confidence in His power, wisdom, and goodness[b]) and by practice of patient endurance and waiting are [now] inheriting the promises."

{"verse": "Hebrews 6:12"}
12 Don't be spiritually lazy, but follow the example of those who through trusting in God and patience inherit what God has promised.

God gave a promise to Abraham which, through Christ Jesus, we are also eligible for.  It is a promise from God, so it is guaranteed, because God cannot lie.

{"verse": "Hebrews 6:13-14"}
13 When God gave his promise to Abraham he could swear by no one greater so he took an oath on himself, 14 saying, “I will definitely bless you, and multiply your descendants.”

All Abraham had to do was believe God's word and receive the promise.  He did not earn the promise by works, he just had faith and received it.  It is the same way for us.  Just believe and receive!

{"verse": "Hebrews 6:15"}
15 And so, after patiently waiting, Abraham **received** the promise.

Your salvation is secure; God will never change His mind.  God gave his promise and he made an oath.  God wants you to have total confidence in your salvation, righteousness by faith, and God's favor over you.

{"verse": "Hebrews 6:16-18"}
16 People swear on things that are greater than they are, and when they have some dispute the oath is taken as the final word on the matter. 17 That's why God wanted to demonstrate more clearly to those who would inherit the promise that he would **never ever change his mind**. 18 So by these two actions that can't be changed, and since it's impossible for God to lie, we can have **total confidence**, having run for safety to take hold of the hope God presented to us.

This hope we have is extremely reliable.

The purpose of all this is so we can enjoy in intimate, close relationship with God our perfect, loving father.  He wants us to enter the holy of holies---the closest place we can be to our heavenly father.

{"verse": "Hebrews 6:19-20"}
19 This hope is our spiritual **anchor**—it's both **certain** and **reliable**, and it takes us past the curtain to the presence of God. 20 That's where Jesus went in on our behalf, because he had become a high priest according to the order of Melchizedek.

Why is this hope reliable?  Because God promised and he will never change his mind.  Jesus has already entered into the Holy of Holies ahead of us as our high priest.

{"verse": "Romans 8:33-34 Amplified"}
33 Who shall bring any charge against God's elect [when it is] God Who justifies [that is, Who puts us in right relation to Himself? Who shall come forward and accuse or impeach those whom God has chosen? Will God, Who acquits us?] 34 Who is there to condemn [us]? Will Christ Jesus (the Messiah), Who died, or rather Who was raised from the dead, Who is at the right hand of God actually pleading as He intercedes for us?

So the basic teaching is righteousness by faith and the first part of the more advanced teaching is to reveal just how solid this hope we have in Christ is.  The rest of Hebrews is full of these more advanced teachings.  But they are all founded on the blood of Jesus.  Take away grace, and these teachings will not make any sense because their foundation is the Good News of Jesus Christ.
