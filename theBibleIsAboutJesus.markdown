The Bible is About Jesus
========================================================================


The bible is all about Jesus.  It is not a "manual for life"; but a love letter from Jesus to us.  Read the bible to see Jesus!  Don't focus on what you do for Jesus, but what Jesus has done for you.  Don't focus on your love for Jesus, focus on His love for you.  Then you will be transformed by beholding His glory and have abundant life.

Jesus to 2 disciples on the road to Emmaus on resurrection day

{"verse": "Luke 24:25-27"}
So he said to them, "You foolish people -- how slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken! Wasn't it necessary for the Christ to suffer these things and enter into his glory?"  **Then beginning with Moses and all the prophets, he interpreted to them the things written about himself in all the scriptures**.

Jesus to the disciples in Jerusalem latter that same day

{"verse": "Luke 24:44-47"}
Then he said to them, "These are my words that I spoke to you while I was still with you, that **everything written about me in the law of Moses and the prophets and the psalms must be fulfilled.**" Then he opened their minds so they could understand the scriptures, and said to them, "Thus it stands written that the Christ would suffer and would rise from the dead on the third day, and repentance for the forgiveness of sins would be proclaimed in his name to all nations, beginning from Jerusalem."

Jesus responding to Pharisees

{"verse": "John 5:37-39"}
5:37 And the Father who sent me has himself testified about me. You people have never heard his voice nor seen his form at any time, 5:38 nor do you have his word residing in you, because you do not believe the one whom he sent. 5:39 You study the scriptures thoroughly because you think in them you possess eternal life, **and it is these same scriptures that testify about me**, 5:40 but you are not willing to come to me so that you may have life.

Recruiting disciples

{"verse": "John 1:45"}
1:45 Philip found Nathanael and told him, "We have found **the one Moses wrote about in the law, and the prophets also wrote about -- Jesus of Nazareth**, the son of Joseph."

The scriptures are intended to give us wisdom for salvation through faith in Jesus.

{"verse": "2 Timothy 3:15"}
3:15 and how from infancy you have known the holy writings, which are able to give you wisdom for salvation **through faith in Christ Jesus**.

{"verse": "Colossians 1:15-17"}
1:15 He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation, 1:16 for all things in heaven and on earth were created by him -- all things, whether visible or invisible, whether thrones or dominions, whether principalities or powers -- **all things were created through him and for him.  1:17 He himself is before all things and all things are held together in him**.


Faith comes specifically from preaching Jesus--revealing Jesus in the bible!  Since the whole bible is about Jesus, we have a lot of material to use to reveal Jesus.

{"verse": "Romans 10:17"}
Consequently faith comes from what is heard, and what is heard comes through **the preached word of Christ**.
