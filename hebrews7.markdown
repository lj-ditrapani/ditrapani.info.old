Hebrews 7
========================================================================

We have covered 6 chapters so far.
These chapters have made some very powerful and explicit points.

- Jesus is greater than the prophets, the angels, and Moses
- Jesus paid for our sins and saved us
- Jesus is our high priest of the order of Melchizadek
- We are commanded to enter God's rest
- Unbelief is the problem today
- The message of righteousness by faith is the foundation
- God wants us to have faith and hope in Christ.
- This hope in Christ is secure and guaranteed.
- We inherit all of God's promises by faith.

This chapter shows the greatness of Jesus as our high priest.
It is a testimony of how guaranteed and secure His priesthood is.
It also shows the purpose of this priesthood is to bring is close to
God.


Melchizadek is greater than the Levitical priests
-------------------------------------------------

Melchizadek is a picture of Christ our high priest as we have seen in
the previous chapters.
Melchizadek blessed Abraham before Abraham did anything to deserve it.

{"verse": "Hebrews 7:1"}
1 Melchizedek was king of Salem and priest of the Most High God. He met
Abraham who was returning from defeating the kings and **blessed him**.

Abraham gave from the spoils of a war against 5 kings which he
miraculously won through God's favor.

Other bibles say "king of righteousness" instead of king of right.
So we see peace comes after righteousness.  Only a righteous person can
have true peace.  We are not capable of becoming righteous by doing the
works of the law trough our self-effort.  But thank God He sent his son
to die for our sins and make us righteous.  That is why, after the cross
and Jesus' resurrection, but before Jesus ascended to heaven, he left us
His peace (John 14:27).  He had done the work to make us right, so now
we can enjoy His peace.

{"verse": "Hebrews 7:2"}
2 Abraham gave him a tithe of all that he had won.  Melchizedek's name
means "**king of right**" while king of Salem means "**king of peace**."

Here, the bible is explicitly stating that Melchizadek is a picture of
Jesus Christ our high priest.  Notice it says **like** the Son of God.
This seems to imply Melchizedek is not Jesus, just a picture of Jesus.

{"verse": "Hebrews 7:3"}
3 We don't have any information about his father or his mother or his
family tree. We don't know when he was born or when he died. **Like**
the Son of God he continues as a priest forever.

He is telling you to think how great Melchizedek ("this man") was, so we
would have a better understanding of how great Jesus is.
This was written to the Hebrews, who regarded Abraham very highly.
To say someone was greater than Abraham was a powerful statement.

{"verse": "Hebrews 7:4"}
4 **Think how great this man was** for Abraham the patriarch to give him
a tithe of what was won in battle.

Again, Abraham had God's promises.  God's promises do not depend on man
and cannot be earned.
They are given out of grace and received in faith.

{"verse": "Hebrews 7:5-6"}
5 Yes, the sons of Levi who are priests were **commanded by the law** to
receive a tithe from the people, their brothers and sisters, who are
descended from Abraham.
6 But Melchizedek who doesn't share their ancestry received tithes from
Abraham, and blessed the one who had **God's promises**.

The focus is still that Melchizedek's priesthood is greater than the
Levitical priesthood.
By extension, Jesus as our high priest under the new covenant is greater
then mortal men as our priests under the old covenant.
God is telling us that
Jesus priesthood is more excellent and supersedes the levitical
priesthood for 2 reasons:

1. Melchizedek blessed Abraham (greater blesses lesser).
2. The Levites paid tithes to Melchizedek through Abraham.

Notice that the focus and theme of the first 10 verses is concerning
priesthood and not tithes.  Tithes are just used as an example to make a
point about Jesus' greatness and supremacy.  This follows the theme of
Hebrews that we have been experiencing through the first 6 chapters:
it's all about Jesus and what He has done for us as our savior and
priest.  It is not about what we can or should do for Him.

{"verse": "Hebrews 7:7-10"}
7 There's no argument that the lesser person is blessed by the one who
is **greater**.
8 In the one case tithes are received by
men who die, but in the other by one who is said to be living.
9 So you could say that Levi, the one who
receives tithes, has paid tithes through being a descendant of Abraham,
10 for he was yet to be born from his father when Melchizedek met
Abraham.


Melchizedek is a picture of Jesus Christ
----------------------------------------

Here we see the first hint of the theme of the next 3 chapters.  The old covenant is gone and the new covenant is here.

The law cannot make you perfect.  You can never attain righteousness by
doing the works of the law.  Therefor, it was necessary to establish a
new covenant with a new priesthood.  Chapters 8-10 will more explicitly
explain the replacement of the old covenant with the new covenant.

{"verse": "Hebrews 7:11-12"}
11 Now if perfection could have been achieved through the priesthood of
Levi (for that's how the **law** was received), what was the need for
another priest to come following the order of Melchizedek, and not
following the order of Aaron?
12 **If the priesthood is changed, then the law needs to be changed
too.**

Verses 13-15 show how Melchizedek is a picture of Jesus.
Jesus is the true "eternal priest".  And he is for us.

{"verse": "Hebrews 7:13-17"}
13 The one we're talking about comes from a different tribe, a tribe
that has never provided priests to serve at the altar.
14 It's clear that our Lord is a descendant of Judah, and Moses said
nothing about priests coming from this tribe.
15 What makes it even clearer is when another priest appears who is
similar to Melchizedek,
16 and who didn't become a priest by virtue of his human ancestry but by
the power of a life that cannot be ended.
17 That's why it says, "You are a **priest forever** according to the
order of Melchizedek."


Jesus' Priesthood is Perfect, Forever and Supreme
-------------------------------------------------

The law did not make us close to God.  Only grace and mercy through the
work of Jesus Christ can accomplish that.
The law is holy and righteous, but it is powerless in making us
righteous.
The new covenant gives us a better hope than the old.

{"verse": "Hebrews 7:18-19"}
18 So the previous rule has been set aside because it was **powerless**
and didn't work,
19 (for the **law** didn't make anything perfect). But now it's been
replaced by a **better hope** by which we can come **close to God**.

Under the old covenant, the Levites were chosen by God, but they were
**NOT** sworn into duty by an oath.  Under the new covenant, Jesus was
chosen by God to be high priest **AND** He was sworn into duty by an
oath from God.

{"verse": "Hebrews 7:20"}
20 This a was not without an oath, even though those who become priests do so without an oath.

Jesus priest hood is guaranteed.  God wants us to feel secure in our
high priest and the salvation, forgiveness, purification, holiness, and
righteousness that He provides us through the cross.

{"verse": "Hebrews 7:21"}
21 But he became a priest with an oath because God told him, "The Lord has taken a solemn vow and **will not change his mind: You are a priest forever**."

God made an oath that Jesus is our priest forever.  This opens the door
for us to have a relationship with God that is **so much better** than
what we would have under the law of the old covenant.
Under the old covenant, we could only have a master-slave relationship
with God in a spirit of fear.  Under the new covenant, we have a
father-child relationship with God in a spirit of son-ship.

Why is this relationship possible?  It is because Jesus paid for our
sins at the cross and made us adopted children of God.  That is what
makes His priesthood so effective.

{"verse": "Hebrews 7:22"}
22 This is how Jesus became the **guarantee** of an agreed **relationship** with God that is **so much better**.

The Levites were sinful men, so they died.  Every generation of
levitical priests eventually died and was replaced by the next
generation.  But Jesus is perfect and without sin, he lives forever and
is our high priest forever.

{"verse": "Hebrews 7:23-24"}
23 There have been many priests because **death** prevented them from being able to continue; 
24 but since Jesus **lives forever**, his priesthood is **permanent**.

Because of this we can be sure of our salvation in Christ.
See how Jesus is for us and working on our behalf.

{"verse": "Hebrews 7:25"}
25 As a result he is able to save **completely** those who come to God
through him, living always to plead their case on their behalf.

Jesus is perfect and without sin.  This is what makes Him qualified to
be our high priest forever.

{"verse": "Hebrews 7:26"}
26 He is exactly the high priest we need: **holy and without fault**,
pure and separate from sinners, and given a place in the highest
heavens.

The work Jesus did on the cross to pay for our sins was perfect.
It is a finished work.  He did it once perfectly, so no more sacrifice
for sins is required.  All the sins of everyone have already been paid
for.

{"verse": "Hebrews 7:27"}
27 Unlike those human high priests, he doesn't need to offer a daily
sacrifice for his sins and then the sins of the people.
He did this **once, and for everyone**, when he offered himself.

If you depend on men to be your priests (whether yourself, or someone
else) to offer sacrifices because of sin to God on your behalf, you
will never be perfectly cleansed and never enter into a close
relationship with God because your guilt remains.  But if you depend on
Jesus to be your high priest, you are perfectly cleansed of all sin and
guilt and can freely come close to God.

{"verse": "Hebrews 7:28"}
28 The **law** appoints **imperfect men** as high priests, but God gave
his solemn vow after the **law**, and appointed his Son,
**perfect forever**.

The next three chapters will deal more explicitly with the replacement
of the old covenant with the new covenant and what that entails.
