Hebrews 7
========================================================================

Melchizadek is a picture of Christ our high priest as we have seen in
the previous chapters.
Melchizadek blessed Abraham before Abraham did anything to deserve it.

{"verse": "Hebrews 7:1"}
1 Melchizedek was king of Salem and priest of the Most High God. He met
Abraham who was returning from defeating the kings and **blessed him**.

Abraham gave from the spoils of a war against 5 kings which he
miraculously won through God's favor.

Other bibles say "king of righteousness" instead of king of right.
So we see peace comes after righteousness.  Only a righteous person can
have true peace.  We are not capable of becoming righteous by doing the
works of the law trough our self-effort.  But thank God He sent his son
to die for our sins and make us righteous.  That is why, after the cross
and Jesus' resurrection, but before Jesus ascended to heaven, he left us
His peace (John 14:27).  He had done the work to make us right, so now
we can enjoy His peace.

{"verse": "Hebrews 7:2"}
2 Abraham gave him a tithe of all that he had won.  Melchizedek's name
means "**king of right**" while king of Salem means "**king of peace**."

Here, the bible is explicitly stating that Melchizadek is a picture of
Jesus Christ our high priest.  Notice it says **like** the Son of God.
This seems to imply Melchizedek is not Jesus, just a picture of Jesus.

{"verse": "Hebrews 7:3"}
3 We don't have any information about his father or his mother or his
family tree. We don't know when he was born or when he died. **Like**
the Son of God he continues as a priest forever.

He is telling you to think how great Melchizedek ("this man") was, so we
would have a better understanding of how great Jesus is.
This was written to the Hebrews, who regarded Abraham very highly.
To say someone was greater than Abraham was a powerful statement.

{"verse": "Hebrews 7:4"}
4 **Think how great this man was** for Abraham the patriarch to give him
a tithe of what was won in battle.

Again, Abraham had God's promises.  God's promises do not depend on man
and cannot be earned.
They are given out of grace and received in faith.

{"verse": "Hebrews 7:5-6"}
5 Yes, the sons of Levi who are priests were **commanded by the law** to
receive a tithe from the people, their brothers and sisters, who are
descended from Abraham.
6 But Melchizedek who doesn't share their ancestry received tithes from
Abraham, and blessed the one who had **God's promises**.

The focus is still that Melchizedek's priesthood is greater than the
Levitical priesthood.
By extension, Jesus as our high priest under the new covenant is greater
then mortal men as our priests under the old covenant.
God is telling us that
Jesus priesthood is more excellent and supersedes the levitical
priesthood because the Levites paid tithes to Melchizedek through
Abraham.

Notice that the focus and theme of the first 10 verses is concerning
priesthood and not tithes.  Tithes are just used as an example to make a
point about Jesus' greatness and supremacy.  This follows the theme of
Hebrews that we have been experiencing through the first 6 chapters:
it's all about Jesus and what He has done for us as our savior and
priest.  It is not about what we can or should do for Him.

{"verse": "Hebrews 7:7-10"}
7 There's no argument that the lesser person is blessed by the one who
is **greater**.
8 In the one case tithes are received by
men who die, but in the other by one who is said to be living.
9 So you could say that Levi, the one who
receives tithes, has paid tithes through being a descendant of Abraham,
10 for he was yet to be born from his father when Melchizedek met
Abraham.

Here we see the first hint of the theme of the next 3 chapters.  The old covenant is gone and the new covenant is here.

{"verse": "Hebrews 7:11-12"}
11 Now if perfection could have been achieved through the priesthood of Levi (for that's how the law was received), what was the need for another priest to come following the order of Melchizedek, and not following the order of Aaron?  12
**If the priesthood is changed, then the law needs to be changed too.**

Verses 13-15 show how Melchizedek is a picture of Jesus.
Jesus is the true "eternal priest".  And he is for us.

{"verse": "Hebrews 7:13-17"}
13 The one we're talking about comes from a different tribe, a tribe
that has never provided priests to serve at the altar.
14 It's clear that our Lord is a descendant of Judah, and Moses said
nothing about priests coming from this tribe.
15 What makes it even clearer is when another priest appears who is
similar to Melchizedek,
16 and who didn't become a priest by virtue of his human ancestry but by
the power of a life that cannot be ended.
17 That's why it says, "You are a priest forever according to the order
of Melchizedek."

The law did not make us close to God.  Only grace and mercy through the
work of Jesus Christ can accomplish that.
The law is holy and righteous, but it is powerless in making us
righteous.
The new covenant gives us a better hope than the old.

{"verse": "Hebrews 7:18-19"}
18 So the previous rule has been set aside because it was **powerless**
and didn't work,
19 (for the **law** didn't make anything perfect). But now it's been
replaced by a **better hope** by which we can come **close to God**.

20 This a was not without an oath, even though those who become priests do so without an oath.

Jesus priest hood is guaranteed.  God wants us to feel secure in our
high priest and the salvation, forgiveness, purification, holiness, and
righteousness that He provides us through the cross.

21 But he became a priest with an oath because God told him, "The Lord has taken a solemn vow and **will not change his mind: You are a priest forever**."

22 This is how Jesus became the **guarantee** of an agreed **relationship** with God that is **so much better**.

23 There have been many priests because **death** prevented them from being able to continue;

24 but since Jesus **lives forever**, his priesthood is **permanent**.

25 As a result he is able to save **completely** those
who come to God through him, living always to plead their case on their behalf.

26 He is exactly the high priest we need: holy and without fault, pure
and separate from sinners, and given a place in the highest heavens.

27 Unlike those human high priests, he doesn't need to offer a
daily sacrifice for his sins and then the sins of the people. He did this once, and for everyone, when he
offered himself.

28 The law appoints imperfect men as high priests, but God gave his solemn vow after the
law, and appointed his Son, **perfect forever**.
