Knowing Jesus as Your Savior
Savior

v
John 14:6-7
Jesus replied, "I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. If you have known me, you will know my Father too.  And from now on you do know him and have seen him."

v
John 10:10
The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come so that they may have life, and may have it abundantly.

v
John 3:16-18.5
For this is the way God loved the world: He gave his one and only Son, so that everyone who believes in him will not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world should be saved through him.  The one who believes in him is not condemned.

v
1 John 4:9-10
By this the love of God is revealed in us: that God has sent his one and only Son into the world so that we may live through him.  In this is love: not that we have loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the atoning sacrifice for our sins.

v
Romans 5:6-11
For while we were still helpless, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly.  (For rarely will anyone die for a righteous person, though for a good person perhaps someone might possibly dare to die.) But God demonstrates his own love for us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. Much more then, because we have now been declared righteous by his blood, we will be saved through him from God's wrath. For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son, how much more, since we have been reconciled, will we be saved by his life?  Not only this, but we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received this reconciliation.

v
Romans 8:37-39
No, in all these things we have complete victory through him who loved us!

v
John 14:1
"Do not let your hearts be distressed.  You believe in God; believe also in me."

v
John 6:28-29
So then they said to him, "What must we do to accomplish the deeds God requires?"  Jesus replied, "This is the deed God requires -- to believe in the one whom he sent."

v
Romans 10:8-12
But what does it say? "The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart" (that is, the word of faith that we preach),  because if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For with the heart one believes and thus has righteousness and with the mouth one confesses and thus has salvation. For the scripture says, "Everyone who believes in him will not be put to shame." For there is no distinction between the Jew and the Greek, for the same Lord is Lord of all, who richly blesses all who call on him.
