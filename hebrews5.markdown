Hebrews 5
========================================================================

The high priest works for the people regarding their relationship to God.  He stands in the middle; representing the people and working on their behalf.

{"verse": "Hebrews 5:1"}
1 Every high priest is chosen from the people and is appointed to work for the people as they relate to God. He presents to God both their gifts and sacrifices for their sins.

The high priest relates to the people.

{"verse": "Hebrews 5:2"}
2 The high priest understands how ignorant and deluded people feel because he also experiences the same kind of human weaknesses.

But human high priests are sinful, so they have to offer sacrifices for their own sins.

{"verse": "Hebrews 5:3"}
3 As a result he has to offer sacrifices for his sins as well as for those of the people.

The position is ordained by God.  The one chosen for the position is not of human will, but out of divine will.

{"verse": "Hebrews 5:4"}
4 No one can take the position of high priest for himself; he must be chosen by God, just like Aaron was.

God chose Jesus, His very own son, to be our high priest.

{"verse": "Hebrews 5:5"}
5 In just the same way Christ did not honor himself by becoming high priest. It was God who said to him, "You are my Son. Today I have become your Father."

Jesus is our priest forever.

{"verse": "Hebrews 5:6"}
6 In another verse, God says, "You are a priest forever, following the order of Melchizedek."

The amplified bible expands "respect for God" to "His godly fear, His piety, in that He shrank from the horrors of separation from the bright presence of the Father".

{"verse": "Hebrews 5:7"}
7 Jesus, while he was here in human form, prayed and appealed with loud cries and tears to God, the one who was able to save him from death. Jesus was heard because of his respect for God.

Jesus is God's son.  Jesus suffered at the cross and paid for our sins so we wouldn't have to.

{"verse": "Hebrews 5:8"}
8 Even though he was God's Son, Jesus learned practically the meaning of obedience through suffering.

The purpose of Jesus' work was to save us.  He saved us perfectly so that we now poses an eternal salvation.  What does Jesus say?  To believe in Him, to trust in Him, to rely on Him, to Receive the righteousness that comes by faith.  Remember, He is our high priest.  A high priest works on behalf of the people in regard to God.

{"verse": "Hebrews 5:9-10"}
9 When his experience was complete, he became the source of eternal salvation to every one who does what he says, 10 having been designated by God as a high priest according to the order of Melchizedek.

He is addressing the Hebrews who have heard about the gospel---the Good News of Jesus Christ---but continue to do works under the law in an attempt to attain righteousness.  This is the state of many Christians today.  So busy trying to earn righteousness, they don't have time to hear and understand the Good News of Jesus Christ.

{"verse": "Hebrews 5:11-12"}
11 We have much to say about Jesus, and it's hard to explain because you don't seem able to understand!  12 By now you should have had enough time to become teachers, but you need someone to teach you the fundamentals, the first principles of God's word. It's like you need to go back to baby milk instead of solid food!

The amplified bible says "inexperienced and unskilled in the doctrine of righteousness" instead of "don't have the experience of living the right way".  What is the doctrine of righteousness?  What is the right way?  We have been hearing it over and over in every chapter of Hebrews.  It is to live believing in God.  It is to live trusting all of your sins are forgiven.  It is to live knowing Jesus is your high priest.  It is to come confidently before the throne of God because you are certain all of you sins have been forgiven and you are made holy and righteous by what Jesus has done.

{"verse": "Hebrews 5:13"}
13 Those who drink baby milk don't have the experience of living the right way---they’re just babies.

What is good in God's eyes?  When we have faith.  Trust and believe in the finished work of Jesus.  Believe that today, God is your father and He loves you.  What is evil is God's eyes?  When we live by works, trusting in our own self-righteousness.

{"verse": "Hebrews 5:14"}
14 Solid food is for grown-ups—those who by always using their brains have learned to tell the difference between good and evil.

God's righteousness is a gift, we can never earn it (Romans 5:17).
