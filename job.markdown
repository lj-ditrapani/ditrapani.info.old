Job had an Old-Covenant Mentality
========================================================================

The more I think about Job and what the holy spirit showed you last night, the more it makes sense.  Job expected God to bless him based on his own good works from his own self-effort.  The purpose of the book is to show us that even if we do everything right, God owes us nothing.

Job wanted to be blessed based on his own form of righteousness instead of submitting to God’s righteousness.  He had an old-covenant mentality.  But God is a God of **grace**.  He only delights in blessing us because of His unmerited favor.  He wants to treat us as beloved children, not hard-hearted slaves.

Under the new covenant we are guaranteed blessings.  There are no curses under the new covenant (the only place for curses is under the old covenant and everyone under the old covenant is under a curse.)  So it shows us, God’s way is to bless us because of Jesus.  We can only receive the blessings by faith in Jesus.  By trusting in and relying on Jesus.  God does not delight in blessing us because of our works of self-effort---the  works of the flesh.  He wants to, and will, bless us when we have faith in Jesus.
