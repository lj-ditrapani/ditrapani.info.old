Hebrews 3
========================================================================

Jesus is the focus.  Jesus is the center.  In the context of the book of Hebrews this is not saying we need to consider Jesus so that we can do works like Him.  But instead, we need to consider Jesus so we can partake and be benefactors in the work that He accomplished.

{"verse": "Hebrews 3:1"}
1 So, my brothers and sisters who live for God and who share in this heavenly calling, we need to **think carefully about Jesus**—the one we say is sent by God, and is the **High Priest**.

Jesus is greater than Moses.

{"verse": "Hebrews 3:2-3"}
2 He was faithful to God in the work he was chosen to do, just like Moses was faithful to God in God's house.  3 But Jesus deserves much greater glory than Moses, in the same way that the builder of a house deserves more credit than the house.

The purpose of all of Moses' work was to witness of the Good News to come.

{"verse": "Hebrews 3:4-5"}
4 Every house has its builder; God is the builder of everything. 5 As a **servant**, Moses was faithful in God's house. **He provided evidence of what would be announced later**.

Moses is a servant, but Jesus is a son.  We get to be part of God's family if we have faith in Jesus.  Faith in Jesus is the only requirement.

{"verse": "Hebrews 3:6"}
6 But Christ is a **son**, in charge of God's house. And we are God's house as long as **we hold on with confidence to the hope we boast we believe in**.

Jesus died to make us all children of God.

{"verse": "John 1:12"}
12 But to all those who accepted him and trusted in him, he gave the right to become **God’s children**.

The servant or slave is a picture of one under the law.  The legitimate son born of a free woman is a picture of someone under grace, living by faith in Jesus.

{"verse": "Galatians 4:1-5"}
Let me explain what I'm saying. An heir who is under-age is **no different from a slave**, even though the heir may be the owner of everything. 2 An heir is subject to guardians and managers until the time set by the father. 3 It's just the same for us. When we were children, **we were slaves** subject to the basic rules of the **law**. 4 But at the appropriate time God sent his **Son**, born of a woman, born under the rule of law, 5 so that **he could rescue those who were kept under the rule of law**, so that we could receive the **inheritance of adopted children**.

- What were the Jews slaves to?  The law.
- Why was Jesus born of a woman?  So he would be under the same law as the Jews.
- Why did he come down to earth as a man?  To rescue us.
- What did we need to be rescued from?  The rule of the law.
- To what did he deliver us into?  The inheritance of adopted children of God.

Notice, the slave boy, living under the law, will be thrown out of God's house and will not partake in the inheritance.  The inheritance is for those who live by faith under grace.

{"verse": "Galatians 4:28-31"}
28 Now my friends, **we are children of promise** just like Isaac. 29 However just as the one born according to a **human plan persecuted** the one **born through the Spirit**, so it is today. 30 But what does Scripture say? “**Send away the servant girl and her son**, for **the son of the servant girl will not be an heir together with the son of the free woman**."  31 Therefore, my friends, we’re not children of a servant girl, but of the free woman.

- What kind of children are we who believe?  Children of promise.
- Who persecutes the believers?  Those under the law (the one born of flesh).
- What happens to those born of the slave; those under the law?  They are sent away and miss out on the inheritance.

So we see God associates servitude with those under the law and sonship with those under Jesus Christ, the son of God.

Don't harden your heart against God's grace and rest.

{"verse": "Hebrews 3:7-11"}
7 This is why the Holy Spirit says, “If you hear what God is saying to you today, 8 **don't harden your hearts** like the time you rebelled against him, when you tested him in the wilderness. 9 Your fathers put me through it, trying my patience, and they saw the evidence I gave them for forty years.  10 “That generation made me angry and so I said, ‘They’re always mistaken in what they think, and they don't know me or what I'm doing.’ 11 So in my frustration I vowed, 'They shall not enter my **rest**.'”

- What was trying God's patience?
- God was showing them evidence of what?
- What made Him angry?

{"verse": "Hebrews 3:12"}
12 Brothers and sisters, make sure that none of you has an **evil mindset that’s given up trusting in the God of life**.

The only requirement to be partners with Christ is to have faith.

{"verse": "Hebrews 3:13-14"}
13 Encourage each other every day while you still have “today,” so that none of you will be deceived by sin and become hard-hearted. 14 **For we are partners with Christ as long as we hold on to our confidence in God from beginning to end**.

Have faith and trust in Jesus.  Trust that God loves you and sent His son to die for your sins.  Trust that God loves you and raised Jesus from the dead for your justification.  Today you are already made holy and righteous by the blood of Jesus; this is God's purpose and desire for your life.  It was done freely by His grace.

{"verse": "Hebrews 3:15-19"}
15 As Scripture says, "If you hear what God is saying to you today, don't harden your hearts like the time you rebelled against him." 16 Who was it that rebelled against God, even though they heard what he said? Wasn't it all those who were led out of Egypt by Moses? 17 Who was God upset with for forty years? Wasn't it those who sinned, those who were buried in the desert? 18 Who was God speaking of when he vowed they should not enter into his **rest**? Wasn't it those who disobeyed him?  19 So we see that **they were not able to enter because they didn't trust him**.

What was the Israelite's disobedience that angered God?  It was their refusal to trust Him and have faith that He would deliver them.  They rather return to being slaves in Egypt than trust God would provided for them in the desert.  The preferred slavery over son-ship!  They preferred the law over grace.

- What was trying God's patience?  Their unbelief.
- God was showing them evidence of what?  His grace and love.
- What made Him angry?  Their unbelief.
