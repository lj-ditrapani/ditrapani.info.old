Hebrews 11
========================================================================

Hebrews 11 is called the _Hall of faith_.  It is a list of the great
works of faith of the heroes of the bible.  Note that it is not works of
the law but works of faith.  Faith is trusting in Jesus that all your
sins are forgiven and that God loves you.  So they did these works
trusting Jesus and knowing God makes them righteous.

{"verse": "Hebrews 11:1"}
Now our **trust** in God is the guarantee of what we hope for, the
evidence of what we can't see.

Other bibles translate trust above as faith.
This is a definition of faith.  Faith is believing and receiving.  You
can't receive God's promises without first having faith.
When you have faith you take possession of the blessings God is giving
you through the work of Jesus.

{"verse": "Hebrews 11:2"}
2 People who lived long ago **trusted** God and this is what gained them
**God's approval**.

When you have faith in Jesus, God approves of you.
God's approval does **NOT** come when you try to do the works of the
law to make yourself right with God.  It comes when you believe the
blood of Jesus has already made you right.
Always remember, righteousness comes by faith, not by works.

{"verse": "Hebrews 11:3"}
3 Through our **trust** in God we understand that the whole universe was
created by God's command, that what can be seen was made
out of what cannot be seen.

The rest of Hebrews 11 are examples of works of faith.

{"verse": "Hebrews 11:4"}
4 By **trusting** him Abel offered God a **better sacrifice** than Cain,
and as a result God identified him as someone who **lived right**. God
showed this by accepting his offering. Even though Abel has been dead
for a long time, he still speaks to us through what he did.

Abel was declared righteous because he offered a better sacrifice than
Cain.  Cain offered from the work of his hands (the fruit offering).
But Abel gave an animal sacrifice that involved blood.  This was a
picture of Jesus sacrifice on the cross shedding His blood for the
forgiveness of sins.

{"verse": "Hebrews 11:5"}
5 By **trusting** God Enoch was taken to heaven so he didn't experience
death. He couldn't be found on earth because God took him to heaven.
Before this happened he was known as someone God was **pleased** with.

Enoch lived by faith and his faith pleased God.

{"verse": "Hebrews 11:6"}
6 You can't expect God to be pleased with you if you don't **trust**
him!  Anyone who comes to God must believe that God exists, and that he
rewards those who are searching for him.

Even Satan and his demons believe God exists.  That is not enough to
please God.  You must believe God exists **AND** has good in store for
you.  How can you be sure God wants to bless you?  You must first be
sure that the blood of Jesus has removed all of your sin and made you
righteous.  Then, once righteous, you can be sure God will bless you.
So have faith in Jesus and be blessed!

When you come into God's presence, the attitude that pleases God is
one that expects God's blessings because of the blood of Jesus
(not because of your own works).

{"verse": "Hebrews 11:7"}
7 Noah **trusted** God, and was warned by him about things that had
never happened before. Because Noah paid serious attention to what God
said, he constructed an ark to save his family. By **trusting** God,
Noah showed that the world was wrong, and received the reward of being
**set right** by God.

Noah's faith in God made him right with God.  He was righteous by faith
(not by works; not because he built a boat; but because he believed God
was good).

{"verse": "Hebrews 11:8"}
8 Through **trusting** God Abraham obeyed when God called him to go to
the land God was going to give him. He left, not knowing where he was
going.

Abraham trusted God, and God did not disappoint.  He became very rich
in land and possessions and became the father of many nations.

{"verse": "Hebrews 11:9-10"}
9 **Trusting** in God he lived in the promised land---but as a
foreigner, living in tents, together with Isaac and Jacob who shared
with him in **inheriting the same promise**.
10 For Abraham was looking forward to a city built on foundations that
last, with God as its builder and maker.

By faith in Jesus we also inherit God's promise as Abraham did.

{"verse": "Hebrews 11:11-12"}
11 By her **trust** in God even Sarah herself was given the ability to
conceive a child though she was too old, because she **trusted** God who
had made the **promise**.
12 That is why the descendants of Abraham, (who was as good as dead!),
became as numerous as the stars of heaven, as countless as the sand of
the sea-shore.

Sarah also received the promise through her faith.

{"verse": "Hebrews 11:13"}
13 They all died still **trusting** in God. Though they didn't receive
the things God promised, they were still looking for them as it were
from a distance and welcomed them, acknowledging that on this earth they
were foreigners, people just passing through.

They died in their faith because Jesus had not come yet.  But we live in
the time after Jesus has redeemed us!  So we live in the best time.  We
already have the result of the promise available, Jesus himself as our
high priest.  The forgiveness of sins.  To be called the children of
God.

{"verse": "Hebrews 11:14-16"}
14 People who say such things make it clear that they're looking for a country of their own.
15 For if they cared about the country they'd left behind, they could have returned.
16 But they're looking for a better country instead, a heavenly country. That is why **God isn't disappointed with them**, and is happy to be called their God, for he has built a city for them.

God is pleased with them because they believed God had something in
store for them that is better what the world has to offer.  They
believed what they couldn't see was better than what they could see.

{"verse": "Hebrews 17-19"}
17 Abraham trusted God when he was tested and offered Isaac to God. Abraham, who had accepted God's promises, was still ready to offer to God his only son,
18 even though he'd been told, "It's through Isaac that your descendants will be counted."
19 Abraham had thought it through and decided that God could bring Isaac back to life from the dead. In a sense that's what did happen---Abraham received Isaac back from the dead.

Abraham offering Isaac is a picture of God offering Jesus as a sacrifice
for the forgiveness of our sins.

{"verse": "Hebrews 20-26"}
20 Trusting in God, Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau in regard to what the future would bring.
21 Trusting in God, Jacob as he was dying blessed each of Joseph's sons, and worshiped God, leaning on his staff.
22 Trusting in God, Joseph too, when his own death approached, spoke about the exodus of the Israelites, and gave instructions about what to do with his bones.
23 Trusting in God, Moses' parents hid him for three months after he was born. They recognized he was a special child. They weren't afraid to go against what the king had commanded.
24 Trusting in God, Moses, when he grew up, refused to be known as the adopted son of Pharaoh's daughter.
25 Instead he chose to share in the sufferings of God's people rather than to enjoy the temporary pleasures of sin.
26 He counted the rejection he experienced from following **Christ** to be of far greater value than the wealth of Egypt---because he was focused on the reward to come.

{"verse": "Hebrews 27-32"}
27 **Trusting** in God, he left Egypt and wasn't scared of Pharaoh's anger---he kept going with his eyes fixed on the invisible God.
28 **Trusting** in God he observed the Passover and the sprinkling of **blood**, so that the destroying angel would not touch the Israelites.
29 **Trusting** in God the Israelites crossed the Red Sea as if it were dry land. When the Egyptians attempted to do the same they were drowned.
30 **Trusting** in God, the Israelites marched around the walls of Jericho for seven days, and the walls fell down.
31 **Trusting** in God, Rahab the prostitute didn't die with those who rejected God, because she had welcomed the Israelite spies in peace.
32 What other examples should I give? I don't have time to talk about Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah; about David, Samuel, and the prophets.

The blood is a picture of the blood of Jesus.

Notice, all the good works were accomplished by faith!

{"verse": "Hebrews 33-34"}
33 Because of their **trust** in God they conquered kingdoms, did what was right, received God's promises, shut the mouths of lions,
34 put out blazing fires, escaped being killed by the sword, were weak but made strong, did mighty deeds in war, and routed enemy armies.

Look at all the amazing things that **faith** accomplishes!

{"verse": "Hebrews 35-37"}
35 Women were given their dead family members back through resurrection. Others were tortured, refusing to compromise and be pardoned, because they wanted to be part of a better resurrection.
36 Yet others suffered insults and whippings; they were put in chains and imprisoned.
37 Some were stoned, cut in pieces, tempted, killed by the sword. Some dressed in sheepskins and goatskins: destitute, oppressed, and mistreated. 

I'm glad we don't have to go through these things!
The only requirement for us is to have faith in Jesus!

{"verse": "Hebrews 38-40"}
38 The world was not worthy to have such people who wandered in the deserts and mountains, living in caves and holes in the ground.
39 All of these people, even though they had God's approval, didn't receive what God had promised.
40 **God has given us something even better**, so that they can't be complete without us.

We have something better; we live after the cross.  We can enjoy all the
blessings and benefits of Jesus as our high priest today.  Not is some
far off future.  Today we can enjoy being redeemed children of God.  We
are not looking at a shadow or an image and hoping that sometime after
we die we will be resurrected.  We have the very One, Jesus the messiah
and we can enjoy all the blessings today.

So now you see, it is only by faith that we can please God.  All of the
old testament heroes that pleased God, they did not earn his pleasure by
doing works of the flesh under the law.  They did not produce
righteousness by working hard to do right.  They had faith.  And out of
that faith come righteousness and a right relationship with God.  And
through the spirit, the good deeds were accomplished.  It was God's
power that accomplished the works, not man's.  But they are all works of
faith, not of the law.
