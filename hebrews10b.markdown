Hebrews 10
========================================================================

{"verse": "Hebrews 10:1-10"}
1 **The law is just a shadow** of the good that was to come, and not the
actual reality. So it can **never** through the repeated sacrifices
offered year after year **make right** those who come to worship God.
2 Otherwise wouldn't the sacrifices have stopped being offered? If the
worshipers had been made clean once and for all, they wouldn't have had
**guilty consciences** any longer.
3 But in fact those sacrifices remind people of sins year after year,
4 because it's impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to remove
sins.
5 That's why when Christ came into the world he said, "You didn't want
sacrifices or offerings, but **you did prepare a body for me**.
6 Burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin gave you no pleasure.'
7 Then I said, 'God, see I've come to do what you want me to do, just as
it says about me in the book.'"
8 As mentioned above, "You didn't want sacrifices or offerings, and
burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin gave you no pleasure," (even
though they are offered in accordance with the law's requirements).
9 Then he said, "See, I've come to do what you want."
**He gets rid of the first agreement so he can set up the second,**
10 through which **we all are made holy through Jesus Christ offering
his body once and for all time**.

{"verse": "Hebrews 10:11"}
11 Every priest officiates in the services day after day, again and
again offering the same sacrifices that can **never remove sins**.

The earthly priests under the law could not remove our sins.
They offered the sacrifices every year; but they were not the real
sacrifices.  Just a shadow of Jesus' sacrifice.

{"verse": "Hebrews 10:12"}
12 But this Priest, after he had offered a **single sacrifice** for sins
that **lasts forever**, sat down at God's right hand.

Jesus only needed to offer the sacrifice once.  Because He is the
perfect sacrifice, the result of the sacrifice lasts forever.
We are perfectly forgiven and perfectly cleansed by the blood of Jesus.

{"verse": "Hebrews 10:13-14"}
13 Now he waits until all his enemies are conquered, becoming like a
footstool for him.
14 For by a **single** sacrifice he has **set right forever** those who
are being made holy.

Jesus offered a single sacrifice, but His sacrifice made us perfect
forever!

{"verse": "Hebrews 10:15-17"}
15 As the Holy Spirit also tells us, for having said,
16 "This is the agreement that I will make with them later on, says the
Lord. I will put my laws in their hearts, and I will write them in
their minds." Then he adds,
17 "I won't remember their sins and lawlessness anymore."

These verses were already quoted in chapter 8.  But the Holy Spirit
really wants to emphasize the point, so He repeats them again here.

- God will write his laws on our hearts.  We no longer try to learn
  God's laws and then try to keep them.
  Instead, God changes our hearts.
- God does not remember our sins because our sins were removed by the
  blood of Jesus.

The law of the new covenant is the law of the spirit.  It is not a law
of works but a law of faith.  It says that you are righteous by faith.

{"verse": "Hebrews 10:18"}
18 Once free from such things, sin offerings are no longer needed.

Once your sins have been completely paid for, there is no longer any
need for another sacrifice.  Jesus completely paid for all your sins;
so there is no more need to offer any other sacrifice.

{"verse": "Hebrews 10:19"}
19 Now we have the **confidence**, brothers and sisters, to enter the
Most Holy Place by the **blood of Jesus**.

It is God's desire that we enter into the Most Holy Place and have an
intimate relationship with our heavenly father.
Notice that access to the father is not based on your works or merit.
It is based on the merit of Jesus' work at the cross.
We enter by his blood, not by our sweat.

{"verse": "Hebrews 10:20-22"}
20 Through his life and death, he opened up a brand-new, living way
through the veil to God.
21 Since we have such a **great priest** placed in charge over the house
of God,
22 let us **come close** to God with sincere minds, totally **trusting**
in him.
Our **minds** have been sprinkled to purify them from our evil way of
thinking, and our bodies have been washed clean by pure water.

We enter into God's presence through Jesus our high priest.
God wants us close to Him because he loves us.
Our part is to trust in what Jesus has done.  Our part is to trust that
our sins are completely forgiven.  Our part is to trust our minds and
bodies are completely cleansed by the blood of Jesus.

{"verse": "Hebrews 10:23"}
23 So let us hold onto the **hope** we're telling others about, never
hesitating, for God who promised is trustworthy.

Hold onto the hope we have.  Don't stop believing and having faith that
you have been made right by the blood of Jesus.

{"verse": "Hebrews 10:24-25"}
24 Let's think about how we can motivate one another to love and to do
what is good.
25 We should not give up meeting together, as some have done. In fact we
should be encouraging one another, especially as you see the End
approaching.

{"verse": "Hebrews 10:26-29"}
26 For if we deliberately go on sinning after we've understood the
truth, there's no longer any sacrifice for sins.
27 All that's left is fear, expecting the impending judgment and the
terrible fire that destroys those who are hostile to God.
28 Someone who rejects the law of Moses is put to death without
mercy on the evidence of two or three witnesses.
29 How much worse do you think someone will deserve
their punishment if they have trampled underfoot the Son of God, if they
have disregarded the blood that sealed the agreement and makes us holy,
treating it as ordinary and trivial, and have abused the **Spirit of
grace**?

Here "deliberately go on sinning" means to reject the finish work of
Jesus and instead try to do works of sacrifice to atone for our sins.
If you reject Jesus, all that is left is fear.  Why?  Because there is
no more sacrifice for sins.  If you reject the one, true sacrifice for
your sins, then your sins remain.  Then all you can do is fear the
impending, inevitable judgement for your sins.

Jesus blood made you more than friends of God.  It made you sons and
daughters of God.  If you reject Jesus, you are hurting the "Spirit of
grace".  Grace is God's unmerited favor.  We don't deserve for Jesus to
pay for our sins and make us Holy.  But He did it for as a free gift
anyway.  When we reject that forgiveness, we hurt the "Spirit of grace".

{"verse": "Hebrews 10:30-31"}
30 We know God, and he said, "I will make sure that justice is done;
I will give people what they deserve." He also said, "The Lord will
judge his people."
31 It's terrifying to come under the power of the living God.

Rejecting the grace of Jesus invites the God's wrath on your head.
But those who live by faith in Jesus invite God's blessings over their
heads.

{"verse": "Hebrews 10:32-34"}
32 Just remember the past when, after you understood the truth, you
experienced a great deal of suffering.
33 Sometimes you were made a spectacle of, being insulted and attacked;
at other times you stood in solidarity with those who were suffering.
34 You showed your sympathy for those in prison, and took it cheerfully
when your possessions were confiscated, knowing that you have something
better coming that will truly last.

The early Hebrew Christians faced a lot of persecution.  But we live in
an even better time where we enjoy freedom to have faith in Jesus.

{"verse": "Hebrews 10:35-36"}
35 So don't lose your confidence in God---it will be richly rewarded.
36 You need to be patient so that having done **what God wants**, you'll
receive what he has **promised**.

What God wants is for you to have faith in Jesus.  Trust in Him.
It is those who live by faith that inherit God's promises just like
Abraham.  God's promises are always received by faith and never earned
by our works.

{"verse": "Hebrews 10:37-39"}
37 "In just a little while he will come, as he said---he won't delay.
38 Those who do what is right will **live by trusting in God**,
and if they **draw back** from their commitment,
I won't be pleased with them."a
39 But we're not the kind of people who **draw back** and end up being
lost.  We are those who **trust in God to save us**.

Again, it reiterates that to do what is right, you must live by faith
(trusting in God).  It is not by doing the works of the law, but by
having faith in Jesus.
When we do not have faith, we are fearful and "draw back" from God.
That does not please God.
