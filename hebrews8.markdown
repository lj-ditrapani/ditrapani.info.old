Hebrews 8
========================================================================

{"verse": "Hebrews 8:1-3"}
1 The **main point** of what we're saying is this: We have just such a
**high priest** who is seated at the right hand of God, who sits in
majesty on his throne in heaven.
2 He serves in the sanctuary, the **true** tabernacle
that was set up by the **Lord** and **not by human beings**.
3 Since it's the responsibility of every high priest to offer gifts
and sacrifices, this high priest must also have something to offer.

The earthly priests were the Levites; but they were priests under the
old covenant law.  Jesus is our priest under the new covenant of grace.

{"verse": "Hebrews 8:4"}
4 Now if he was here on **earth**, he wouldn't be a priest at all,
because there are **already priests** to
present the offerings that the **law requires**.

The earthly tabernacle, the earthly priests, and everything under the
old covenant were only a picture to point us to Jesus and the new
covenant.

{"verse": "Hebrews 8:5"}
5 The place they serve is a **copy, a mere shadow** of what is in
**heaven**. That's what God told Moses when he was going to set
up the tabernacle: "Be careful to make everything according to the
**blueprint** you were shown on the mountain."

Jesus' ministry under the new covenant is **far better** than the
old covenant ministry of the law.  The covenant and the promises
are much better as well.

{"verse": "Hebrews 8:6"}
6 But Jesus has been given **a far better ministry** just as he is
the one who mediates **a far better** agreed relationship between
us and God, which is based on **much better promises**.

The old covenant was not perfect.  It was not complete.  It was just
a forerunner of the new covenant.  It prepared the way.

{"verse": "Hebrews 8:7"}
7 If that first agreement had been perfect, then a second
wouldn't have been necessary.

God himself declares the old covenant as inadequate.
The old covenant points out your failures, but the new covenant makes
you righteous.  The Lord gives us His righteousness as a gift in the
new covenant.

{"verse": "Hebrews 8:8"}
8 Pointing out their **failings**, God told his people,
"Pay attention,' says the Lord, because the days are coming when
**I will make a new agreement**
relating to the house of Israel and the house of Judah.

The new covenant is not like the old.  Do not confuse the two.  Even
under the old covenant, God was showing and wanted to show the
Israelites grace and favor.  The amplified bible says that God
withdrew His favor because they didn't keep the agreement.
So the old covenant, under the law, only worked if man did his part.

{"verse": "Hebrews 8:9"}
9 This will **not** be like the promised agreement I made with their
ancestors when **I led them** by the hand out of the land of Egypt.
For they didn't keep their part of the agreed relationship, so I gave
up on them, says the Lord.

But in the new covenant, God does all the work.  This is God's
definition of the new covenant.

{"verse": "Hebrews 8:10"}
10 "The relationship **I** promise to the house of Israel is this:
After that time, says the Lord, **I** will place my laws in
their minds, and write them on their hearts. **I** will be their God,
and they will be my people.

Everyone who has faith will have a personal, direct relationship with
the Lord.

{"verse": "Hebrews 8:11"}
11 No one will need to teach his neighbor, and no one will need to
teach anyone in their family, telling them,
'You ought to know the Lord.' For everyone will know me, from
the smallest to the greatest.

This is the main point of the new covenant.  It is repeated in
chapter 10.  It means your sins are forgiven.
Of course, this is only possible
because of what Jesus did on the cross.  This is how God can be
righteous and at the same time merciful.  He is not letting your sins
go unpunished.  He already punished them all at the cross.  Now He can
be righteous in giving you grace and favor because you have taken on
the robe of righteousness that Jesus has given you.  You receive His
righteousness just as he took you sins to the cross.

{"verse": "Hebrews 8:12"}
12 I will be merciful when they do wrong, and I will forget about
their sins."

The old covenant is obsolete.  It is not legal for you to be under the
law anymore.  It is only legal for you to be under the new covenant by
faith in Jesus.

{"verse": "Hebrews 8:13"}
13 By saying, "A new agreed relationship," he makes the first
agreement out-of-date. The one that's old and worn out has
almost disappeared.
