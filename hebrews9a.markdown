Hebrews 9
========================================================================

Chapters 1-7 have been showing us how Jesus is superior to the old
covenant in different ways and that everything in the old covenant was
merely a picture of Jesus in the new covenant.
Chapter 8 showed us God's definition of the new covenant.
The new covenant is God writes His law of faith on your heart and all
your sins have been forgiven through the work of Christ Jesus on the
cross.

Remember, the **former system** (the old covenant) was only an earthly
representation of the true heavenly things.

{"verse": "Hebrews 9:1"}
1 The **former system** had instructions as to how to worship, and an
**earthly** sanctuary.

{"verse": "Hebrews 9:2"}
2 The first room in the tabernacle housed the candlestick, the table,
and the **sacred bread**. This was called the **Holy Place**.

The **sacred bread** is a picture of Jesus:
Jesus said "I am the bread of life".

{"verse": "John 6:35"}
Jesus said to them, "I am the **bread** of life. The one who comes to me
will never go hungry, and the one who **believes** in me will never be
thirsty."

The tabernacle had a holy section and a holy-of-holies or
**Most Holy Place** section.  They were separated by a curtain.
Any priest could go into the holy section.
But only the high-priest could go into the holy-of-holies section.
There were exacting requirements to enter the holy-of-holies.
The **Most Holy Place** is a picture of the most intimate and closest
place to God.  It is an image of God's throne room in heaven.

{"verse": "Hebrews 9:3"}
3 Past the second **veil** in the tabernacle was the room called the
**Most Holy Place**.

The **agreement chest** is also called the ark of the covenant.
The agreement chest is shaped like a coffin and within it are reminders
of Israel's sin.  Israel's sin has been covered by the ark and no one is
allowed to open the ark to see Israel's sin.

In the same way, the Jesus covered our sin.  Actually, he did more than
cover our sin, He completely paid for all our sins, so they do not
remain anymore.

{"verse": "Hebrews 9:4"}
4 This contained the golden altar of incense, the gold-covered
"**agreement chest**." Inside this were the golden pot containing
manna, Aaron's rod that had produced buds, and the stone inscriptions of
the agreement.

When the stone was rolled away from Jesus tomb, there were two angels in
the tomb.  The work of Christ brought us reconciliation with God.
The place of **reconciliation** is also called the mercy seat.
Jesus' work on the cross transformed God's judgement seat into a mercy
seat.  Now we can come to God and receive mercy instead of judgement.

{"verse": "Hebrews 9:5"}
5 Above this were the glorious angel cherubim covering the place of
**reconciliation**. We can't discuss all of this in detail now.

The significance of the blood sacrifice is that
"Without shedding blood nothing is made free of sin" Hebrews 9:22.
Jesus is our perfect blood sacrifice, so we have been made perfect
forever by the shedding of His blood.

Comment from The Free Bible Version on Hebrews 9:7
> Blood is a frequent theme in the latter part of Hebrews. It is a
> shorthand symbol for life, and the shed blood of death, and while the
> original context of the sacrificial system is certainly literal, its
> use in Hebrews when applied to Christ is primarily as a symbol of what
> he accomplished by his life, death, and resurrection.

{"verse": "Hebrews 9:6-7"}
6 Once all of this had been set up, the priests would go in regularly to
the first room of the tabernacle to perform their duties.
7 But only the high priest went into the second room, and only once a
year. Even then he had to make a sacrifice involving **blood**, which he
offered for himself and for the people's sins of ignorance.

This is God's direct interpretation of the meaning of the tabernacle
system.  As long as we continue to observe the first tabernacle
(the old covenant way), the holy-of-holies---intimacy with God---is not
available.

{"verse": "Hebrews 9:8"}
8 By this **the Holy Spirit** indicated that the way into the true
**Most Holy Place** hadn't been revealed while the first tabernacle
still existed.

Comment from The Free Bible Version on Hebrews 9:8

Why is intimacy with God unavailable under the old covenant?
Because we would still have a guilty conscience.
Only Jesus' blood can cleanse our conscience.

{"verse": "Hebrews 9:9"}
9 This is an illustration for us in the present, showing us that the
gifts and sacrifices that are offered **can't** make the worshiper's
**conscience clear**.

Chapter 8 described the new covenant as God writing his law of faith on
our hearts and the complete removal of sins.  Through this, everyone who
believes would know God, from the least to the greatest.  So intimacy
with God is not accomplished through the old covenant, but through the
new covenant.
Mainstream Christians still live an "old covenant" relationship with
God.  They are constantly mindful of there sins which produces a guilty
conscience, instead of being constantly mindful of Christ's
righteousness and His work on the cross, which produces a pure
conscience.
When you have a guilty conscious, you stay outside the holy-of-holies,
offering sacrifices for your sins because you are afraid of entering the
most holy place.

That is the revelation Sofi and I received October 2012.  We were
constantly offering sacrifices for our sins because we had a guilty
conscience.  We were always confessing our sins, going to alter calls,
asking for pastors to pray for us, and going to Christian counseling.
Even serving at church was a way for us to "pay God back" for our sins.

Thank God for Jesus because he paid the debt and set us free from a
guilty conscience.

Today, I still see many Christians that have that old covenant mindset.
They do many works for God, but it is driven by fear and guilt.
They believe by their many works, they can pay God back.
You can never pay for your sins.  Only Jesus can.
Because only He is perfect.

Jesus work at the cross was and can only be a free gift.
You must accept it freely as he has given it freely with no strings
attached.  To do otherwise is to say that Jesus' work is not enough.

{"verse": "Hebrews 9:10"}
10 They're just religious regulations---about food and drink,
and various ceremonies involving washing---which were put in place
until the time of God's new way of relating to him.

Jesus is our true **high priest** and he went into the
**true holy-of-holies** on our behalf with the perfect offering for all
our sins to bring about perfect and complete forgiveness of sins.
He did not need to make a sacrifice for himself because there is no sin
in Him.

{"verse": "Hebrews 9:11"}
11 Christ has come as a **high priest** of all the good experiences we
now have. He went into the greater, more complete tabernacle that wasn't
made by human hands---not part of this created world.

Jesus paid with His own blood which made us perfect forever!

{"verse": "Hebrews 9:12"}
12 He didn't enter through the blood of goats and calves, but through
his **own blood**. He entered once, for **all time**, into the
**Most Holy Place, setting us free forever**.

The blood under the old covenant made the Israelites ritualistically
clean.  The blood of the goats and bulls were just pictures of the true
cleansing blood of Jesus.  When you receive Jesus' blood that he shed on
the cross to pay for your sins, you are made completely clean.

Notice that:

1. Jesus is completely sinless.
2. You cannot serve God with a guilty conscience.
3. God wants you to have a clean conscience so you can be close to Him
   and know Him as your father.

A clean conscience does not mean you never sin.
It means you know that your sins have been paid for.

{"verse": "Hebrews 9:13-14"}
13 For if the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a cow sprinkled
on those who are ritually unclean make the body ceremonially clean,
14 how much more does the blood of Christ---who offered himself in his
**sinless life** to God through the eternal Spirit---**clean your
consciences** from your past sinful lives so you can **serve the living
God**?

Jesus has set us free from our sins through His death on the cross.
The result is that our sins are forgiven and we now receive the promise
of an eternal inheritance.  If we believe in the work of Jesus than
we inherit the promise of eternal life and all of God's blessings.
We can now receive God's grace, favor, health, wealth, and everything
that goes along with an abundant life.

{"verse": "Hebrews 9:15"}
15 This is why he is the mediator of **a new agreed relationship**.
Since a death has occurred to **set them free from the sins committed**
under the first agreed relationship, now those who are called can
**receive the promise of an eternal inheritance**.

We will cover verses 16-28 in more depth next week.  For now we will
just read them to get an understanding of the whole chapter.

{"verse": "Hebrews 9:16-28"}
16 For a will to be implemented, the person who made it must be dead.
17 A will is only valid when there's been a death---and is never
applied while the person who made it is still alive.
18 That's why the first agreement was established with blood.
19 After Moses had given all the commandments of the law to everyone,
he took the blood of
calves and goats, and together with water, scarlet wool, and hyssop,
sprinkled the book itself and all the people.
20 He said to them, "This is the blood of the agreed relationship that
God has told you he wants with you."
21 Moses sprinkled the blood in the same way on the tabernacle and
everything used in worship.
22 According to ceremonial law, almost everything is made clean with
blood, and without shedding blood nothing is made ritually free from
the stain of sin.
23 So if the copies of what is in heaven needed to be cleansed in this
way, the things in heaven needed cleansing by better sacrifices.
24 For Christ hasn't entered a Most Holy Place constructed by human
beings that is only a pattern of the original. He has entered heaven
itself, and now appears on our behalf, speaking for us in God's
presence.
25 This was not to repeatedly offer himself, like a high priest has to
enter the Most Holy Place year after year, offering blood that is not
his own.
26 Otherwise Christ would have had to suffer many times since the
creation of the world. No: just this one time at the end of the present
age he came to remove sin by sacrificing himself.
27 Just as human beings only die once, and then are judged,
28 so too for Christ---having been sacrificed once to take away the
sins of many people, he will come again, not to deal with sin, but to
save those who wait for him.

<!--
Don't listen to those who try to make you sin conscience and give you a guilty conscience.  It is not God's will for you to have a guilty conscience, but a pure conscience.  It is not God's will for you to be sin-conscience, it is God's will for you to be Christ conscience.
