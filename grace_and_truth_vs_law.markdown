Grace and Truth vs. the Law
========================================================================

Grace and truth are on the side of the new covenant under Jesus Christ.  The law is on the side of the old covenant.  The truth belongs with grace (God's unmerited favor and blessing) not on the side of the law (where man works to try to make himself right with God.)

{"verse": "John 1:14"}
And the Word (Christ) became flesh (human, incarnate) and tabernacled (fixed His tent of flesh, lived awhile) among us; and we [actually] saw His glory (His honor, His majesty), such glory as an only begotten son receives from his father, **full of grace (favor, loving-kindness) and truth**.


{"verse": "John 1:17"}
For while the Law was given through Moses, **grace (unearned, undeserved favor and spiritual blessing) and truth** came through Jesus Christ.


{"verse": "Hebrews 3:1-6"}
1 SO THEN, brethren, consecrated and set apart for God, who share in the heavenly calling, **[thoughtfully and attentively] consider Jesus**, the Apostle and High Priest Whom we confessed [as ours when we embraced the Christian faith].  2 [See how] faithful He was to Him Who appointed Him [Apostle and High Priest], as Moses was also faithful in the whole house [of God].  3 **Yet Jesus has been considered worthy of much greater honor and glory than Moses**, just as the builder of a house has more honor than the house [itself].  4 For [of course] every house is built and furnished by someone, but the Builder of all things and the Furnisher [of the entire equipment of all things] is God.  5 And Moses certainly was faithful in the administration of all God's house [but it was only] as a ministering servant. [In his entire ministry he was but] a testimony to the things which were to be spoken [the revelations to be given afterward in Christ].  6 But Christ (the Messiah) was faithful over His [own Father's] house as a Son [and Master of it]. And it is we who are [now members] of this house, if we hold fast and firm to the end our joyful and exultant confidence and sense of triumph in our hope [in Christ].


Living under the law will cause you to live by the flesh.  Living under grace will cause you to live by the spirit.

Jesus is a free son, and he came to make us also free children of God, born again.  It is only by grace.


{"verse": "Galatians 4:21-31"}
21 Tell me, you **who are bent on being under the Law**, will you listen to what the Law [really] says?  22 For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the bondmaid and one by the free woman.  23 But whereas the child of the slave woman **was born according to the flesh** and had an ordinary birth, the son of the free woman **was born in fulfillment of the promise**.  24 Now all this is an allegory; these [two women] represent two covenants. One covenant originated from Mount Sinai [where the Law was given] and **bears [children destined] for slavery**; this is Hagar.  25 Now Hagar is (stands for) Mount Sinai in Arabia and she corresponds to and belongs in the same category with the present Jerusalem, for **she is in bondage together with her children**.  26 But the Jerusalem above (the Messianic kingdom of Christ) **is free**, and she is our mother.  27 For it is written in the Scriptures, Rejoice, O barren woman, who has not given birth to children; break forth into a joyful shout, you who are not feeling birth pangs, for the desolate woman has many more children than she who has a husband.  28 But we, brethren, are children [not by physical descent, as was Ishmael, but] like Isaac, **born in virtue of promise**.  29 Yet [just] as at that time the child [of ordinary birth] **born according to the flesh** despised and persecuted him [who was **born remarkably] according to [the promise and the working of] the [Holy] Spirit**, so it is now also.  30 But what does the Scripture say? **Cast out and send away the slave woman and her son, for never shall the son of the slave woman be heir and share the inheritance with the son of the free woman.**  31 So, brethren, we [who are born again] are not children of a slave woman [the natural], but of the free [the supernatural].

- law vs grace
- flesh vs spirit
- slave vs free
- physical descent vs promise
